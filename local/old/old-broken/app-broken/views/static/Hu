<p style="text-align: left;">We are an interdisciplinary group of <a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/hu/people.html">faculty, postdoctoral scientists, and students</a> working at the interfaces of biology, geology, and climatology. Graduate students in our group enroll in <a href="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/plantbio/">Plant Biology</a>, <a href="http://www.geology.uiuc.edu/">Geology</a>, or the campus-wide <a href="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/peeb/">Program in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a>.

<p>We study ecosystem dynamics in relation to past climatic change at various spatial and temporal scales. Our investigations are primarily based on proxy records preserved in geological deposits (lake sediment and peat). We use a wide array of methods in our research, including the analyses of pollen, charcoal, stable isotopes (O, C, and N), organic compounds, and molecular-genetic markers. We maintain a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.life.illinois.edu/hu/equipment.html">state-of-the-art, comprehensive laboratory</a>.</p>
