The support for this latest cohort is $600  million over five years.</p>\r\n                <p>The HHMI, one of the nation&rsquo;s  largest philanthropies, has a total of 355 investigators, selected through  rigorous national competitions. The investigators include 13 Nobel Prize  winners and 124 members of the National Academy of Sciences. </p>\r\n                <p>Aside from generous research  support, what makes the HHMI investigator appointment so vaunted is that it  &ldquo;funds the person, not the project.&rdquo;&nbsp;  According to the HHMI, the institution &ldquo;values innovation and encourages  its investigators to extend the boundaries of science. Investigators have the  freedom to explore and, if necessary, to change direction in their research.  Moreover, they have support to follow their ideas through to fruition &mdash; even if  that process takes many years.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an incredible gift,&rdquo; says  Newmark. &ldquo;Being an HHMI investigator gives you the freedom to focus on your  science and tackle high-risk projects that may be difficult to pursue in the  current funding climate. HHMI provides resources that enable you to follow your  nose.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>Newmark has, in fact, been  following his nose ever since the mid-1990s, when he became intrigued by the  planarian, a free-living flatworm with an astounding ability to regenerate.  Since then, he has been instrumental in resurrecting the planarian as a model  system. Planarians can regenerate an entire organism, including a new brain,  from nearly any part of the body; a population of adult stem cells provides the  source of cells for regeneration. </p>\r\n                <p>One intriguing aspect of planarian  biology, from Newmark&rsquo;s perspective, is the animal&rsquo;s ability to regenerate germ  cells, the precursors of egg and sperm cells, <em>de novo</em> from stem cells.  Newmark finds germ cells fascinating because they are highly differentiated yet  they maintain their totipotency&mdash;the ability to produce all the cells in an  organism.</p>\r\n                <p>Being named an HHMI investigator is  recognition that others have faith in his ideas. </p>\r\n                <p>The appointment is also gratifying  to members of MCB, who demonstrated similar faith in 2001 by offering Newmark  his first independent faculty position.</p>\r\n                <p>The vast majority of scientists  devote their careers to making steady but incremental progress on previously  established lines of <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/2009420newmark/Images/newmark_microscope.jpg\" alt=\"Phil Newmark\" id=\"left\" />research,&rdquo; said CDB chair Andrew Belmont at the time of  the announcement. &ldquo;In contrast, a very select, very small group of scientists  instead pioneer completely new approaches and methodologies, which then serve a  much broader community. Dr. Newmark falls into the latter class of scientists,  and it is tremendously satisfying to see the HHMI reward him for his vision,  risk-taking, and hard work.&rdquo; </p>\r\n                <p>Newmark is one of three HHMI  investigators at the University of Illinois. In 2005, physics professor Taekjip  Ha was named an HHMI investigator, and chemistry professor Wilfred van der Donk  was appointed at the same time as Newmark. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;The Hughes funds have allowed my  group to pursue several new experimental avenues and have permitted me to  expand my research team. The number of excellent young scientists interested in  planarians continues to grow and it is great to be able to bring some of them  on board,&rdquo; says Newmark. </p>\r\n                <p>Some of these new experimental  approaches involve moving from microarray analysis to next generation  sequencing technologies to characterize some cell types in the planarian. These  experiments should help elucidate how stem cells choose different fates and  progress along various differentiation pathways. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;These resources will help us  improve our knowledge of the planarian genome, which will be of use to the  whole community,&rdquo; says Newmark. &ldquo;We hope to have a much more complete picture  of the cell types in which these genes are expressed on a different scale than  we&rsquo;ve been able to achieve thus far.&rdquo; </p>\r\n                <p>The lab also just received a new  confocal microscope that will dramatically improve their imaging capabilities.  The new microscope will provide better resolution and reconstruction of tissues  in the animal, and is able to separate more colors, so more markers to  distinguish more different cell types and components of different organs can be  used. Plans are also afoot to develop techniques for culturing planarian stem  cells.</p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been really itching to get  started,&rdquo; says Newmark. &ldquo;Now that the culture room has been renovated, we can  get to work.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>Without the Hughes appointment,  Newmark would not be able to embark on these experiments. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;If you are in survival mode and  just to try to get by, it&rsquo;s unlikely that you&rsquo;ll do new things until you can  make sure the old things are okay,&rdquo; says Newmark. The Hughes appointment &ldquo;will  enable us to branch out and to pursue questions at a different level than we  have in the past.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>One of those big questions is, what  are the signals or cues that tell a cell to become a germ cell? Ongoing  molecular investigations in Newmark\'s lab hold the promise of defining the  make-up of a germ cell, and whether the signaling that triggers germ cell  development has been conserved across species.</p>\r\n                <p>Asking these kinds of compelling  questions has driven Newmark for much of his career. And his colleagues have  taken notice: the HHMI investigator position is <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/2009420newmark/Images/_JKL82581.jpg\" alt=\"Planarians.\" id=\"right\" />just the latest of several  honors he has received, including being one of five recipients nationwide of  the 2003 Damon Runyon Scholar Award and the 2003 CAREER Award from NSF.&nbsp; </p>\r\n              <p>In 1988, after earning a bachelor&rsquo;s  degree in biology from Boston University, Newmark went to graduate school at  the University of Colorado, Boulder. He worked with <em>Drosophila</em> in Robert  Boswell&rsquo;s lab to learn how organisms make germ cells and how determinants get  localized in the embryo to tell cells how to differentiate. </p>\r\n                <p>Then, having read some papers on  regeneration in planarians for a journal club, Newmark discovered a fascination  with that topic. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;I thought they were the coolest  animals I had seen,&rdquo; says Newmark of planarians. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of these fantastic  unanswered questions: how do organisms regenerate? Very few scientists were  looking at that process with molecular techniques.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>Newmark was surprised to discover that no one  in the U.S. was working with planarians to study regeneration at a molecular  level; in fact very few people worldwide were studying regeneration in any  system. So, to learn more about the biology of planarians, Newmark began his  postdoctoral work in the laboratory of Jaume Bagu&ntilde;a at the University of  Barcelona. Not only did he learn planarian biology in Barcelona, but his  daughter, Elena, was also born there. </p>\r\n                <p>After a chance meeting at a  scientific conference in York, England, Newmark joined forces with Alejandro  S&aacute;nchez Alvarado (now an HHMI investigator at the University of Utah), who was  studying regeneration in amphibians at the Carnegie Institution of Washington&rsquo;s  Department of Embryology in Baltimore. Newmark worked with S&aacute;nchez Alvarado for  about five years and together they were able to make some major breakthroughs  that helped revitalize the study of planarians. For example, labs had been  trying since the late 1960s to label planarian stem cells and no one had  succeeded. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;I spent several years failing  miserably (at that project), as had everybody who worked on planarians since  the 1960s,&rdquo; says Newmark. &ldquo;Entire labs had shut down and switched to other  organisms because they could not label the planarian stem cells.&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>A scientist friend of Newmark&rsquo;s  suggested he just feed the planarians one such label, BrdU. </p>\r\n          <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great idea, why don&rsquo;t I  try it?&rdquo; Newmark remembers thinking.<br />\r\n&nbsp; <br />\r\n              <img src=\"Images/IMG_0507.JPG\" alt=\"annecarpenter\" id=\"left\" />At this point in his life, Newmark&rsquo;s  second child, Carl, was very young and Newmark remembers being completely sleep  deprived. </p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;It was probably one of the worst  experiments I&rsquo;ve ever done,&rdquo; Newmark laughs. &ldquo;I globbed the label with the  liver paste planarians typically eat and just dropped it into the water. The  water got all cloudy. It was a disaster, but the worms did eat it. I didn&rsquo;t  really know what concentration of label they ingested; the way I did it, who  knows?&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>Soon afterwards, Newmark fixed the  six planarians for staining. Late one night he was ready to look at them under  the microscope.</p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;The first one: nothing; the second  one: nothing; third one: nothing; fourth one: nothing and I&rsquo;m thinking, why do  I keep doing this?&rdquo; says Newmark. &ldquo;Why do I keep wasting my time? Fifth one:  nothing. But the sixth one was just beautiful. I called Alejandro at home and  told him &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not going to believe it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n                <p>Newmark felt that same sense of  stunned surprise the day last spring when he returned from a faculty meeting.  There was a &ldquo;very, very light Fed Ex envelope on the floor of my office. We get  oligonucleotides sent to us via Fed Ex all the time and my first thought was,  &lsquo;why am I getting oligos in my office?&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>\r\n                <p>Then he saw the return address said  Tom Cech, president of HHMI, and his very next thought was, &ldquo;this is way too  thin to be good news_items.</p>\r\n                <p>&ldquo;So I opened it up and &hellip; I had to  sit down for several minutes. Then I staggered out to the lab to have someone  else read it to make sure it said what I thought it said,&rdquo; he says, beaming.</p>\r\n                <p>Next Newmark called his wife,  Sonia, who was in Boston visiting her family, and then took his lab out to  dinner. </p>\r\n                <p>The next day, they were back at  work.</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/faculty_research/images/headshots/newmark_phil_02.jpg',1,'2009-06-09 11:07:00','MCB	CDB','Feature','jhaas','2009-06-09 11:09:41','2009-06-11 17:08:24','Deb Aronson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(10,'Brian Freeman\'s research published in <i>Nature Structural & Molecular Biology</i>','The journal <i>Nature Structural & Molecular Biology</i> has just published an article by Brian Freeman, professor of cell and developmental biology in the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology at the University of Illinois.

While researching songbirds, David Clayton\'s lab provided one  of the first examples of a gene responding to a social signal. Clayton and his  team found that shortly after a finch hears the new song of a male finch,  expression of a gene called&nbsp;<em>egr1</em>&nbsp;increases,  creating a protein that regulates the expression of other genes in the  brain.<br />&nbsp;<br />\r\n  Discovering that a social  cue, like hearing the song of a competitor, altered gene expression in the  brain was an exciting find.&nbsp; It &quot;was a eureka moment for me,&quot;  Robinson said.<br /><br />\r\n			    Robinson\'s own lab went on to  find thousands of genes in the brain of honey bees that turn on or off in  response to social cues from fellow bees.<br />\r\n				</p>\r\n				<div id=\"contact\">\r\n                  <div class=\"center\"><img src=\r\n			\r\n			\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20081117gene_expression/clayton_david_w_hd.jpg\"\r\n			\r\n			alt=\"David Clayton\" name=\"profile2\" height=\"209\" border=\"0\" id=\"profile2\"/></div>\r\n				  <div id=\"text2\">\r\n				    <p align=\"center\"><strong>David Clayton</strong></p>\r\n				    <p align=\"center\">Photo by L.

This behavior is controlled by a pheromone, a  chemical and social signal made by foragers to tell their fellow bees not to  forage.<br />\r\n			    <br />\r\n			    If the hive lost some of its  foragers, however, the loss of pheromone would allow the foraging genes in some  younger bees to turn on &ndash; creating new foragers. <br />\r\n			    Genes do not typically  dictate behavior directly, the authors note, but rather create molecules  responsible for building the brain. The resulting brain function and activity  is what determines behavior.&nbsp;<br />\r\n			    <br />\r\n			    The nature-versus-nurture  debate is still prominent in both science and society, and the issue is  becoming increasingly complex.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a dynamic relationship between  genes and behavior,&rdquo; Robinson said. &ldquo;Behavior is not etched in the  DNA.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n			    <br />\r\n			    The review covers other  social systems like the treatment of queens in fire ant colonies and the  mothering methods of rats.<br />\r\n			    &nbsp; <br />\r\n				  Robinson and Clayton\'s review  appears in the journal <em>Science</em>.

Medical  school hopefuls and job seekers also have an upper hand.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;During the medical school interview process I  was asked a question regarding my research at every interview,&rdquo; said Christoff,  who is now a fellow at the University of Chicago  Medical Center.&nbsp; </p>\r\n				<p>Salyers agrees medical students benefit from a robust research  experience. &quot;They have  an advantage in the sense that they have had practical experience with some of  the material many students find particularly difficult about molecular biology,&quot;  she said. </p>\r\n				<p>Salyer&rsquo;s own undergraduate  student, Vlamakis, has received her Ph.D. from the University of California,  Berkeley. &ldquo;I think her experience with this undergraduate research was very  helpful not only getting her into graduate school, but when she got into  graduate school she had the kind of [scientific] maturity and experience that  many students don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo; Salyers said. </p>\r\n				<p>Undergraduate research experience not only helps students  land a job interview or get into graduate school, but helps them determine what  path is right for them. &ldquo;Prior to joining a lab, I planned to go to medical school,&rdquo; Crofts said.</p>\r\n				<p> Now a  postdoctoral fellow, Crofts mentored an undergraduate student herself and looks  back fondly at the work she did as an undergraduate. &ldquo;My positive  experiences in the laboratory ultimately changed the entire course of my  career,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n				<p> The benefits of  undergraduate research extend beyond the students&rsquo; time at the University of  Illinois.&nbsp; &ldquo;I  met many amazing people working in the lab at UIUC, and still keep in touch  with a few,&rdquo; Christoff said.&nbsp;&ldquo;Everyone was always very encouraging and positive;  it was a great environment to learn in.&nbsp; I also have met many people in  the medical field who have also done research at UIUC, some 20-30 years before  me, and have been able to make wonderful connections by discussing our  experiences.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>Undergraduates interested in research should read <a href=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/undergradlab/index.html\">How to Find, Join, and Succeed in a Faculty Laboratory.</a></p>\r\n		<p>Read <a href=\"http://mcb.uiuc.edu/news_items/feature/97\">Part I: First Courses Introduce Advanced Techniques</a></p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/undergradlabexperience.jpg',1,'2009-06-17 13:13:00','MCB','Feature','gillespi','2009-06-17 13:15:23','2009-08-07 19:53:42','Alex Crofts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(88,'<i>Neural Systems Modeling</i>, by Thomas Anastasio','In August, 2009, Sinauer Associates Inc. publishes <i>Neural Systems Modeling</i>, by Thomas Anastasio, associate professor of molecular and integrative physiology. The book was selected by the publisher as their featured book for the spring.','From the publisher\'s website:\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNeural systems models are elegant conceptual tools that provide satisfying insight into brain function. The goal of this new book is to make these tools accessible. It is written specifically for students in neuroscience, cognitive science, and related areas who want to learn about neural systems modeling but lack extensive background in mathematics and computer programming.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe book opens with an introduction to computer programming. Each of twelve subsequent chapters presents a different modeling paradigm by describing its basic structure and showing how it can be applied in understanding brain function. The text guides the reader through short, simple computer programs—printed in the book and available by download at the companion website—that implement the paradigms and simulate real neural systems. Motivation for the simulations is provided in the form of a narrative that places specific aspects of neural system behavior in the context of more general brain function. The narrative integrates instruction for using the programs with description of neural system function, and readers can actively experience the fun and excitement of doing the simulations themselves. Designed as a hands-on tutorial for students, this book also serves instructors as both a teaching tool and a source of examples and exercises that provide convenient starting points for more in-depth exploration of topics of their own specific interest.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe distinguishing pedagogical feature of this book is its computer programs, written in MATLAB, that help readers develop basic skill in the area of neural systems modeling. Actual data on real neural systems is presented in the book for comparison with the results of the simulations. Also included are asides (“Math Boxes”) that present mathematical material that is relevant but not essential to running the programs. Exercises and references at the end of each chapter invite readers to explore each topic area on their own.

Satish Nair, and Affiliate Professor of Biochemistry Wilfred van der Donk have identified and analyzed an iron-containing enzyme involved in a bond-breaking reaction. ','With the help of X-ray crystallography, researchers have identified and structurally analyzed an iron-containing enzyme that carries out a tricky bond-breaking reaction. The findings could inspire versatile new catalysts.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBacteria make phosphinothricin, a natural product widely used as a weed killer, with several unusual steps. One includes the cleavage of a very poorly activated carbon-carbon bond in 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP), a phosphinothricin precursor.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBecause unactivated C–C bonds are tough to break with the known synthetic tool kit, scientists want to understand how this transformation takes place, says chemist Wilfred A. van der Donk of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, who has been working to understand phosphinothricin biosynthesis. But until now his team \"didn\'t know what kind of enzyme did the job and whether cofactors were required for it to work,\" he says.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSo van der Donk\'s group joined forces with structural biologist Satish K. Nair and microbiologist William W. Metcalf, both at Illinois. The team has now solved the enzyme\'s X-ray structure and identified it as a nonheme iron-containing oxygenase (Nature, DOI: 10.1038/nature07972). The enzyme, hydroxyethylphosphonate dioxygenase (HEPD), uses molecular oxygen to cleave the poorly activated C–C bond in HEP.\r\n\r\n\r\n-from <i>Chemical and Engineering News</i>\r\n<br /><br />','',1,'2009-06-17 13:51:00','MCB	Biochem	Micro','News','gillespi','2009-06-17 14:03:56','2009-06-17 16:08:07','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(94,'An Emerging Field for a Rising Professor','Assistant Professor of Microbiology Carin Vanderpool, never predicted she would be in the position she is today.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAfter only two years at the University of Illinois she has created a lab from the ground up, been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and made great strides with small RNAs—a newly developing area of research in cellular regulation. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nAs a successful new faculty member, Vanderpool seems to have chosen her career wisely, but she wasn’t always sure that academia was the right path.','<div id=\"contact\">\r\n                  <div class=\"center\"><br /><img src=\r\n			\r\n			\"/features/20081220vanderpool/Vanderpooltest.jpg\"\r\n			\r\n			alt=\"Maria Spies.\" height=\"199\" border=\"0\" id=\"profile\"/></div>\r\n				  <div id=\"text\">\r\n                    <p align=\"center\"><strong>Carin Vanderpool</strong></p>\r\n                    <p align=\"center\">Assistant Professor of Microbiology</p>\r\n                    <p align=\"center\">Photo by L.

Other  scientific fields like chemistry competed for her interest as an undergraduate  student, but she ultimately decided biology was her calling. &ldquo;I took a  microbiology course when I was a junior in college and really loved it,&rdquo; she  recalls.<br />\r\n				  <br />\r\n				  Most of the introductory courses Vanderpool took focused on  the cells of complex multicellular organisms, like humans. She found the  material interesting, but the simpler yet intricate bacterial systems she  studied in microbiology captivated her.<br /><br />\r\n				  A bacterial cell has to turn some of its genes on and off in  response to changing environmental conditions, such as colder temperatures. In contrast,  a multicellular organism may have fur or can migrate long distances to adapt to  a change in their environment. Bacterial cells lack those luxuries. <br />\r\n				  <br />\r\n&ldquo;It was fascinating to me that in a much simpler system, a  single-celled organism does basically the same essential life processes that a  much more complex cell does,&rdquo; Vanderpool said. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;They have all these elegant ways of regulating their genes  to respond to really diverse environmental changes that a multicellular  organism is shielded from by virtue of having all of those cells cooperating to  make a larger organism.&rdquo;<br /> &nbsp;<br />\r\nAfter Vanderpool found her passion for the subject, she was  able to conduct research in the lab of her microbiology course professor. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;He had a project trying to create these bioreactors using  microorganisms to break down waste products. It was a project for the Navy, so  they were trying to remediate what they called &lsquo;grey water,&rsquo; which is what goes  down their sinks and their showers.&rdquo; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough she enjoyed her time in the lab, she still wanted  to consider all options for her future, not just research. &ldquo;I applied for a few  jobs my senior year,&rdquo; she said, although many job options available at the time  did not interest her. &ldquo;I knew I didn&rsquo;t want to be a sales representative for a  drug company or anything like that.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;Vanderpool faced the  difficult decision familiar to most undergraduates. Job hunting can be tough  without work experience, and graduate school is not for everyone. &ldquo;I started  thinking about what I did want to do&mdash;continuing on in research.&rdquo; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanderpool decided to further her education at the  University of Minnesota, and hoped to research something more medically  relevant. The University of Minnesota offered a variety of research labs which allowed  Vanderpool to find something she was interested in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just a single department you were going into, it  was multiple departments that had gathered together to make a larger graduate  program,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;Once I started grad school I quickly saw it was the  right decision.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVanderpool&rsquo;s Ph.D. work focused on the bacterium <em>Bordetella  pertussis</em>, which is responsible for whooping cough. This research found the  balance between microbiology and medical relevance she was looking for. &ldquo;The  lab I was in was interested in how bacteria acquire iron in the environment,  especially bacterial pathogens like <em>Bordetella</em>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIron is essential for life, and many bacterial species have  the ability to actively acquire iron from their environment. A human pathogen  like <em>Bordetella</em> attempts to acquire  iron from the host&rsquo;s heme or hemoglobin, a compound typically used by the host  to deliver oxygen throughout the body. If <em>Bordetella </em>can utilize the iron that is naturally found in the host, it may have a  better chance at survival and infection.&nbsp; <br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;The <em>Bordetella</em> genome had been sequenced&hellip;so we identified a gene cluster that we thought was  a good candidate for a heme utilization system. My Ph.D. work essentially  involved characterizing the function of those genes and how they were  regulated,&rdquo; Vanderpool said. At the same time, a new area of research caught  her attention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;I knew of this new field that was coming into existence at  that time&mdash;figuring out how small RNA molecules regulate gene expression, and I  thought it was really cool. I was interested in regulation from my Ph.D. work  and this was a brand new mechanism of regulation.&rdquo;          <br /><br />        <div id=\"contact\">\r\n                  <div class=\"center\"><br /><a href=\"/features/20081220vanderpool/Sgrs.jpg\"><img src=\r\n			\r\n			\"/features/20081220vanderpool/Sgrs.jpg\"\r\n			\r\n			alt=\"Gene Robinson.\" height=\"199\" border=\"0\" id=\"profile\"/></a></div>\r\n				  <div id=\"text\">\r\n                    <p align=\"center\"><strong>Small RNA Sgrs</strong></p>\r\n                    <p align=\"center\">The suspected structure of Sgrs, <br />\r\n                       277 nucleotides in length.\r\n                    \r\n                    <p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n                    <p class=\"small\"> </p>\r\n			      </div>\r\n		    </div>\r\n				<p>Small RNA (small ribonucleic acids) have been overlooked and  understudied for decades, in part because of their small size. The first small  RNA was discovered by chance, and others proved to be difficult to identify and  isolate for further research.<br /> <br />\r\nThe function of these short RNA sequences was mysterious.  The traditional function of RNA is to provide the blueprint for a unique  protein. It appeared, however, that the cell did not use small RNAs to make any  useful proteins. Small RNA remained an outcast in the molecular popularity  contest for decades, but now researchers like Vanderpool have begun describing  the important roles of small RNA.<br /><br />\r\nAfter receiving her Ph.D. for her work on Bordetella,  Vanderpool went to the National Cancer Institute to begin her work in this  novel area of research. &ldquo;They had identified a list of small RNAs, but they  didn&rsquo;t know what hardly any of them did.&rdquo; Vanderpool said. &ldquo;When I first started,  I was working on three or four of these, taking a few different approaches to  try and figure out what they might be doing.&rdquo;<br /><br />\r\nVanderpool was part of a lab that was pioneering small RNA  characterization. &ldquo;My post-doc advisor, Susan Gottesman, was the leading person  in that field at the time&mdash;really she still is,&rdquo; Vanderpool said. <br /><br />\r\nVanderpool was able to bring her research from the National  Cancer Institute with her when she joined the University of Illinois faculty in  2006. Since then, her research has been published in the Proceedings of the  National Academy of Sciences, and describes the novel function of the small RNA  named Sgrs in sugar stress.<br /><br />\r\nBacteria use a sugar transporter to transport glucose inside  their cells to use for energy. Too much glucose, however, and the cell will be  overloaded. In order to respond to the stress of excess glucose, the Vanderpool  lab found Sgrs performs two functions to prevent the transport of glucose into  the cell. <br /><br />\r\n&nbsp;One section of Sgrs codes  for a protein that prevents the cell&rsquo;s current sugar transporters from bringing  in more glucose. A second section of Sgrs prevents the cell from producing new  glucose transporters. The discovery was unique because Sgrs preformed two  functions to respond to the same cellular stress, including protein production.  This bi-functionality exemplifies how small RNAs can play important roles in  cell survival. <br /><br />\r\nVanderpool&rsquo;s short time in the School of Molecular and  Cellular Biology has been efficient and productive for such a new faculty  member. Within two years Vanderpool had turned an empty lab into a fruitful  environment producing great research. Her lab now includes two graduate  students who are close to writing their first manuscripts. Vanderpool taught  Microbial Physiology for a year and enjoys teaching and having discussions with  her students. <br /><br />\r\nShe also enjoys working in the lab with her graduate  students, even though organizing a professor&rsquo;s responsibilities is not always  easy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get to do as much hands-on bench work as I used to do,  especially when I&rsquo;m teaching, but I still do some and that&rsquo;s a lot of fun for  me,&rdquo; she said.<br /><br />\r\nLike many students and researchers, Vanderpool&rsquo;s path was  never clearly defined. &ldquo;[8 years ago] I was in the throes of my graduate  studies and not sure where I would go next,&rdquo; she said. Vanderpool&rsquo;s recent  transition from student to professor gives her a unique perspective on her  career. <br /><br />\r\n&ldquo;A lot of students see their advisors really busy and really  stressed out, and I think sometimes we don&rsquo;t do a very good job of showing our  students that this is actually fun, that were doing this because it&rsquo;s  enjoyable, and we can&rsquo;t imagine ourselves doing anything else. I think I try to  show that to my students, and I guess I would say that would be my advice for  students in general&mdash;to not shy away from something because you think it looks  hard,&rdquo; Vanderpool remarked.<br /><br />\r\n&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. If I had to go back I would do  the same things again.&rdquo;','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20081220vanderpool/vanderpool_homepage.jpg',1,'2009-01-05 14:52:00','MCB	Micro','Feature','gillespi','2009-06-22 14:55:33','2009-06-24 09:11:50','Alex Crofts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(95,'21st Annual CMB-MB Symposium','The Cell and Molecular Biology & Molecular Biophysics (CMB-MB) Training Grant Program celebrated its 21st annual research symposium in fall of 2008.

By the end of the semester  students have used the same techniques that researchers utilize in their labs.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  This experience continues in the second required lab  course, MCB 253, Experimental Techniques in<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/Partners.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"226\" id=\"right\"/> Cell Biology, which is paired with  MCB 252, Cells, Tissues, and Development, a lecture-discussion course.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  A lab manual provides students with  background information and the procedure for every lab. The purpose and function of  materials used and possible alternative methods are included. Before coming to  class, students write objectives, predictions,  and the full procedure for an experiment in their lab notebooks. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  Using the notebooks like a professional researcher would, they record procedural amendments,  data, and interpretations for every lab. \r\n<br /><br />Presentations given in the lab  by graduate student teaching assistants (TAs) are available online to help  students study and clarify questions they  have with an experiment.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  Quizzes ensure that students  understand the  procedures and theory for each exercise. Exams test everything from knowledge of  reagents to applying the methods learned in solving new problems.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  A whirlwind of behind-the-scenes  activity in  the lab complex allows every student to have the full experience, while also working with a partner.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  Each week, more than 650 students  participate in laboratory exercises. Each lab room can accommodate 14 classes of 24 students over five days. Each  semester, one course is taught concurrently  in three lab classrooms, essentially tripling the effort in terms of  teachers, preparatory staff, supplies, equipment, and space.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  The scheduling is tight and the work fast-paced. After one  section has finished, the lab must be  <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/Tubeholder.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" id=\"left\"/>prepared for the next section. Reagents need to be dispensed, equipment reset, lab benches cleaned, waste handled,  and materials returned to prep rooms.\r\n<br /><br /> Incredibly, this turnaround is done in only ten minutes on busy days. A morning lab that starts at 8 a.m., for  example, finishes ten minutes before the noon lab sections arrive.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  In order to pull off such a feat, the help of a preparatory  staff of about 16 undergraduate students is enlisted, said Blinstrup. They distribute materials (such as  pipettes and Petri dishes) to students and prepare other necessities, including buffers and reagents, for each  lab. Every week a prep-staff meeting  is held to discuss and review specific protocols.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n			  Everything needed to pull off a successful lab is organized, tested, and recorded by the course staff.  &ldquo;We have very extensive &lsquo;prep sheets&rsquo; prepared for the labs,&rdquo; explained  Blinstrup.\r\n<br /><br />Course staff also work with a  dedicated group  of nearly 30 TAs every semester, with one assigned to each class section and  others running intricate preparation  protocols, sometimes weeks ahead of each lab. <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/TA.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" id=\"right\"/>The TAs present the  experimental concepts and procedures to their class before the lab.\r\n<br /><br />While  students are working, TAs circulate to help with  equipment and techniques, ensure understanding, and encourage students  to consider the reasoning behind each step of the protocol.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n		    Each week the TAs meet with their course&rsquo;s coordinator.  The meetings allow them to review procedures and key points that students need  to learn, said Blinstrup. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nCoordinators also present the lesson plan for the  exercise, with TAs sharing first-hand knowledge and tips to help the labs run  efficiently. Many TAs teach the same course for several semesters.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very helpful to us. We like having our veteran  TAs return,&rdquo; said Nicholas Kirchner,  a teaching lab specialist along with Blinstrup, &ldquo;and they enjoy sharing their  ideas with the rest of the TAs.&rdquo; <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/TA2.jpg\" width=\"150\" height=\"226\" id=\"left\"/>Because they also work in faculty research labs for their graduate studies, the TAs represent  an essential connection to new developments in techniques covered in  undergraduate labs.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n		    Undergraduate lab courses allow an avenue for students to  run experiments and interpret results. By getting the expected results, a  student&rsquo;s understanding is bolstered.\r\n<br /><br />However, if they get unexpected data, &ldquo;then you  actually have a far greater opportunity to teach,&rdquo; suggested Deb Bielser,  coordinator of undergraduate instruction.\r\n<br /><br />She explained that a student may see  unexpected results as a failure, but in reality,  &ldquo;you can say &lsquo;Look, here are your results. Why did you get these?&rsquo;&rdquo;\r\n<br /><br />\r\n		    Narrowing that gap in understanding is one of the best  ways to complete the student-to-scientist  transformation, and it is working. MCB majors are consistently chosen for internships  and full-time jobs in technical and research  areas, a testament to the strength of the labs available to students.\r\n<br /><br /><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/LabNotebook.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" id=\"right\"/>\r\n		    The lab syllabuses for MCB 251 and 253, both taken during  an MCB major&rsquo;s sophomore year, read like job descriptions from the  biotechnology industry. Techniques include genetic regulation, transformation,  plasmid manipulation, cloning, restriction analysis, PCR, electrophoresis,  SDS-PAGE, (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), western  blot, GFP (green fluorescent protein), unknown plasmid and protein  identifications, growing fibroblasts, actin staining, and more. <br /><br />\r\n		    Other skills that are taught and evaluated include the  writing of detailed lab reports with complete analyses of results, experimental design, presentation of results to the  class, and discussion of current topics as they relate to the techniques.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n		    Students are given a wide array of  experiences to  prepare them for advanced coursework&mdash;which may include an MCB 290 experience working in a faculty research lab&mdash;and for graduate or professional school or a multitude of  career opportunities.<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/Tube.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" id=\"left\" />\r\n<br /><br />\r\n  &ldquo;Illinois has managed to put on a quality program for a  huge number of students,&rdquo; said John Landgraf, senior vice president of global pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply for Abbott Laboratories.\r\n<br /><br />Landgraf added that the lab procedures and  concepts students are taught at Illinois extend far beyond bench  research. &ldquo;What they&rsquo;re learning at school  can be adapted into the industrial culture pretty quickly.&rdquo;<br /><br />\r\n				  Kelly Galanos, a junior in MCB, had this to say about her  MCB 251 and 253 experiences: &ldquo;When reading about GFP transformations and their  contributions in molecular and cellular biology, I thought it was an advanced  technique only used by the most skilled biologists. I am very proud of being  able to use the same techniques as well as understand how they work. I felt like an analytical scientist when I was  able to map various genes on a plasmid using the size of the DNA fragments that were cut by restriction enzymes. MCB 251 and  253 have provided me with a solid foundation  <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/Flame.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" id=\"right\"/>of laboratory techniques that I can build  upon in the future in a research setting.&rdquo;\r\n<br /><br />\r\n				  Said Bielser, &ldquo;In medicine or the  biotech industry, the big conversations are about gene therapy, drug delivery, transforming cells,  and implanting cells in organisms. And PCR is used for everything these days, from forensics to food  production; it is a basic fundamental tool. I think once you understand a  process and you&rsquo;ve done it, then you have a  very good grasp of what&rsquo;s actually entailed and what it means. You can have intelligent conversations about  things that are very current.&rdquo;\r\n<br /><br />\r\n				  She concluded, &ldquo;This all comes down to cell and molecular  science. Through things like tissue culture, PCR, and recombinant DNA, students  understand cell modifications and become part of a more informed society.&rdquo;<br /><br />\r\n<a href=\"\r\nhttp://mcb.uiuc.edu/news_items/feature/87\">Read Part 2: Undergraduate Research in Faculty Labs</a>\r\n</p>\r\n				<p>Undergraduates interested in research should read <a href=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/undergradlab/index.html\">How to Find, Join, and Succeed in a Faculty Laboratory.</a></p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/images/undergradlabexperience.jpg',1,'2008-07-22 15:16:00','MCB','Feature','gillespi','2009-06-22 15:46:41','2009-08-07 19:54:24','Alex Crofts',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(98,'MCB Selected for New \'Scope','With the support of a major grant from the Roy J.

Of course it&rsquo;s a lot  slower than that, and a lot more work than that!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n <p>Wilson excelled in math and  chemistry at her rural Arkansas high school. She was on her own in terms of how to  realize her dreams, but that was not a problem for her.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;My philosophy has always been to start  at the top and work my way down,&rdquo; said Wilson with a grin and a shrug.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Wilson applied to five top colleges and  took the best offer, which was a full scholarship at Barnard College in New  York City. Majoring in both biochemistry and German (Wilson&rsquo;s mother is German)  and minoring in chemistry, Wilson threw herself into her college coursework.  When it came to graduate school, Wilson started at the top again. Her best  offer came from the chemistry department at Johns Hopkins, where her thesis  project was focused on antibiotic biosynthesis, including peptide synthesis and  protein chemistry. This suited Wilson&rsquo;s goal, which was to better understand  basic, mechanistic cell processes in order to fully investigate biological  questions down the road.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;I like when I can see how something  works, and not just memorize facts,&rdquo; said Wilson.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In the 1980s, when Wilson was completing  her doctorate and considering postdoctoral positions, academic research in  antibiotics was virtually nonexistent.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;Academia couldn&rsquo;t compete with  pharmaceutical companies, so I looked around to see what else I was interested  in,&rdquo; said Wilson. &ldquo;I wanted it to be helpful, of course.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Wilson decided to investigate the field  of bacterial protein toxins and ways to combat them by developing antitoxins.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;Until recently, people were not all that  aware of toxin-mediated diseases and how bad they are,&rdquo; said Wilson. &ldquo;Now,  because of the anthrax scare, everyone realizes we have very few tools to  battle toxin-mediated diseases.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n <p>There are two ways to combat toxins, one  is to vaccinate a given population against a particular toxin and the other is  to develop an antitoxin that works after an individual is exposed.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>In the late 1980s, researchers were just  beginning to understand the mechanics of how classic toxins, like diphtheria  and cholera, work. So Wilson signed on as a postdoctoral fellow with John  Collier at Harvard University, the so-called &ldquo;king of bacterial toxins.&rdquo; The  laboratory was looking at the structure, function, and mode of action of  bacterial toxins with the idea to make better recombinant vaccines. Wilson  spent much of her postdoctoral studies figuring out how toxins, particularly  the diphtheria toxin, worked.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>However, as debilitating as  toxin-mediated disease is, it only affects a small number of people. For  example, there might be 300 botulism cases per year. As Wilson knew from her  antibiotic work, pharmaceutical companies are not motivated to develop a  vaccine with such a small market.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The other approach, and one Wilson was  interested in even as a postdoctoral fellow, was to treat victims  post-exposure. The hurdle with this approach is getting the antitoxin inside  the cell, where the toxin is doing its dirty work. Current antitoxins, which  are based on antibodies, cannot do this. This means that even once a patient  gets the antitoxin treatment it takes weeks for the toxin already in the cells  to clear from the body and for the patient to recover. For example, in the case  of botulism, which causes paralysis via the botulinum neurotoxin produced by <em>Clostridium</em>, patients must be on a  ventilator to breathe. In addition, the antitoxin serum cannot reverse the  paralysis, so although nerves can regenerate, recovery is slow and not always  complete. It typically takes months for the toxin to clear the body and months  to years of physical therapy to recover.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>The  secret, Wilson thought, was to understand how the toxin got inside the cell and  use that knowledge to design a better antitoxin. Wilson has spent the last  three years working on developing a better botulinum neurotoxin inhibitor (to  stop the action of the toxin) and to create a delivery system to get that  inhibitor inside the nerve cells. She is about to test her new, improved  botulism antitoxin on animal models.<br />\r\nAfter leaving Harvard for a faculty  position at Wright State University, Wilson decided to expand her research to  include the toxin from <em>Pasteurella  multocida</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;I got interested in this one because it  almost killed me,&rdquo; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Like so many toxin-producing bacteria, <em>Pasteurella multocida</em> only becomes  dangerous if the host is already immunocompromised. One day in 1989, while  still a postdoc, Wilson went to a petting zoo with her son. Afterwards they  both washed their hands, but it turned out Wilson had a bit of strep throat at  the time. The next thing she knew, she had spent three weeks in Massachusetts  General Hospital in Boston.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;I made Grand Rounds!&rdquo; she said, her grin  belying the severity of her illness.</p>\r\n\r\n <p><em>Pateurella</em> is a nasty pathogen. Before it was all  over, Wilson&rsquo;s eardrums had burst, blood and pus spewing from her ear. She lost  her sense of balance and all hearing in her right ear. Soon the infection  spread to her other ear. She got meningitis and had to have a spinal tap. The  massive doses of antibiotics made Wilson&rsquo;s hair fall out. Still, the  antibiotics couldn&rsquo;t nail the <em>Pasteurella</em> completely because it hides in the tonsils. Finally, Wilson was healthy enough  to have a tonsillectomy. It took four months for her to completely recover;  Wilson still has poor hearing in her right ear.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>Coincidentally, 1989, the year Wilson had  her personal wrestling match with <em>Pasteurella</em>,  was the year that the <em>Pasteurella</em> toxin was first cloned and sequenced.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;It is a fascinating toxin,&rdquo; said Wilson.  &ldquo;<em>Pasteurella</em> is a normal microbe  found in about 60 percent of domestic animals as part of their normal flora. Its  toxin has different effects, depending on the particular tissue cell it  encounters. In addition, the toxin has multiple targets inside the cells and  those targets are different from the target of other bacterial toxins.</p>\r\n\r\n <p>&ldquo;This means it is not only interesting to  study, but helpful as a cell biology tool,&rdquo; said Wilson.</p>\r\n				  \r\n				  <p><em>Pasteurella </em>toxin, Wilson has found, typically works by  dampening the immune system, so that hosts end up with a chronic infection  (unless, as in Wilson&rsquo;s case, there is a coinfection). This chronic infection  can result in detrimental long-term effects. This is why Wilson&rsquo;s ultimate goal  is to use the microbe&rsquo;s own mechanisms (<em>i.e.,</em> toxins) to design therapeutics. It will take a while and a lot more work, but  Wilson is confident that she will prevail and that it will be worth the effort.</p>','/images/09222007_wilson_brenda_01.jpg',1,'2007-06-01 14:02:00','MCB	Micro','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-01 14:04:25','2009-07-01 14:36:52','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(115,'Faculty Profile: David Krantz','When David Kranz was born, his parents got a two-for-one deal.

The family of eight would pile into the family station wagon. On the  return trip the car would always be slightly fuller, with a snake, turtle, or  other creature the boys smuggled along.</p>\r\n				  \r\n			<p>&ldquo;My parents were pretty tolerant, I must say,&rdquo; said  Kranz, shown here at a lab meeting with his students. &ldquo;They were always saying, &lsquo;go, do what you have fun doing.&rsquo; And they  also really took academics seriously.&rdquo;</p>\r\n			\r\n  <p>It was at Illinois State University, earning his  bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s degrees that Kranz developed a more focused interest in  molecular approaches to biology. He was most inspired by Herman Brockman, a  classical geneticist.</p>\r\n  <p>&ldquo;He had such an enthusiastic, powerful way of  teaching that I got really excited about that,&rdquo; said Kranz.</p>\r\n  <p>Kranz did undergrad and master&rsquo;s thesis research on  the <em>Serratia marcescens</em> bacteria. He  then worked as a laboratory technician for a few years in order to decide on  his next step. He took a position at Rush Medical School in Chicago in the  immunology department, which turned out to be a pivotal step in the evolution  of his research interests. The job helped him recognize that immunology was the  field for him. It also made him realize that he wanted to get a Ph.D.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to run the projects myself and guide the  research, not just take orders,&rdquo; said Kranz.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>In 1978 Kranz came to the U of I to earn a doctorate  in Ed Voss&rsquo;s microbiology laboratory. Voss was the only immunologist in the  basic sciences at the time but Kranz liked the environment, both in the lab and  outside of it.<br />\r\n&ldquo;I liked being around other graduate students,&rdquo; said  Kranz. &ldquo;We had a softball team, even Ed was on the team. It&rsquo;s that kind of  atmosphere I was really looking for: not just science, but science balanced  with a fun time.</p>\r\n\r\n  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an easy atmosphere to both do hard work and  to go out and have fun in,&rdquo; said Kranz of the University of Illinois. &ldquo;Partly,  the campus is set up so you can do that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n  \r\n		    <p>Another good thing about his graduate school  experience was that Kranz met his future wife, Del, who was a technician in the  department. After graduate school, Kranz went to the Massachusetts Institute  for Technology (MIT) for a postdoctoral appointment. Among others, he worked  with Susumu Tonegawa and Herman Eisen.</p>\r\n			\r\n		    <p> Eisen, a preeminent immunologist, has been the most  influential scientist in Kranz&rsquo;s career, he said. And Tonegawa, who won the  Nobel Prize in 1987 for discoveries about antibodies, was one of the first to  use molecular biology to study the immune system.</p>\r\n			\r\n<p>&ldquo;Cloning genes into a vector was the fundamental  thing in the 70s and 80s that became doable,&rdquo; said Kranz. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d take a gene  that codes for some protein and clone it into a vector, which was at that time  almost always one we grew up in <em>E. coli.</em> Then we&rsquo;d isolate the vector/plasmid and take the gene and put it wherever we  wanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It has become so much easier to do molecular  biology,&rdquo; noted Kranz. &ldquo;In the early 1980s it was a real feat just to do hardly  any molecular biology. Now it&rsquo;s really easy, which is why 100 times more labs  are doing it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n		    <p> Kranz, Eisen, and Tonegawa, along with other  colleagues, successfully isolated the T cell receptor genes, and published  several <em>Nature</em> papers on cloning and  identifying these genes. When the time came to apply for faculty positions,  Kranz had no intention of returning to his home state.</p>\r\n			\r\n<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I  would come back here, actually,&rdquo; said Kranz. &ldquo;But when I visited, my mind was  refreshed on how the style of living was really good. I was also reminded about  the collegiality of the faculty. If you&rsquo;re away for five years, you get swept  up in the East Coast, MIT mentality. I thought I needed to stay in that  atmosphere to compete. But then when I came here I realized there are other  aspects of living here that I value.&rdquo; He also was reminded how much fun it  would be to work with such talented undergraduate and graduate students.</p>\r\n\r\n			<p>  These days, Kranz and his lab continue to work on  understanding T cells. He has focused his efforts on designing therapeutic  approaches based on his basic research findings. He and his colleagues have  successfully engineered the T cell receptor, improving its binding ability, and  in so doing have developed a way to speed the process of drug discovery.</p>\r\n			\r\n		    <p>With Professor Dane Wittrup, then in Chemical  Engineering at U of I, Kranz established a company based on this technology, known  as &ldquo;yeast display.&rdquo; In 2002 Abbott Labs, an Illinois-based company, acquired Kranz&rsquo;s  company.</p>\r\n			\r\n		    <p>A lot has changed, both inside the laboratory and  outside, in the two decades since Kranz first arrived as an assistant professor.  Instead of being the only immunologist in the basic sciences, he shares the  floor with five others. Kranz&rsquo;s daughter just graduated from the U of I with a  degree in MCB and his son, whose primary interest is soccer, attends Centennial  High School.</p>\r\n			\r\n		    <p>And, while it is true that Kranz and his brother  are still fascinated with nature, Kranz promised they no longer tuck wild animals  into their family cars.</p>','/images/06232007kranz_JKL8550.jpg',1,'2008-01-01 14:05:00','MCB	Biochem','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-01 14:07:04','2009-07-01 14:57:43','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(116,'Faculty Profile: Phil Best','Phil Best, professor of molecular and integrative physiology, grew up hiking, camping, and hunting in Maryland.

Best remembers that Schmidt-Nielsen kept various  exotic animals, including an ostrich, in the basement of the zoology building  in order to measure their blood gases during exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his  undergraduate senior thesis, Best wrote a computer program that modeled how  albatrosses used dynamic soaring to fly for thousands of miles over the open  ocean. Albatrosses do not use thermal air currents like hawks and eagles do.  Instead, they take advantage of the wind shear over the ocean. Wind velocity  decreases as it approaches the water&rsquo;s surface, and albatrosses take advantage  of this by flying high and either downwind or slightly off the wind, gradually  losing some altitude. At the point when they&rsquo;ve used up almost all the kinetic  energy from the wind, they have just enough to turn into the wind and glide back  up, at which point they head down wind again. So albatrosses can fly, with  minimal flapping, for thousands of miles in an endless loop pattern. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>As interesting  as that project was, Best realized that his interests were shifting toward  smaller scale systems. &ldquo;I was really  interested in comparative physiology, but it seemed that the more interesting  advances were being made at the cellular and molecular level,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular,  Best found himself intrigued by how excitable cells&mdash;nerve and muscle cells&mdash;function.  In order to pursue this line of inquiry, he went to the University of  Washington to earn his doctorate in physiology and biophysics. Seeking a  diversity of experiences, both scientific and cultural, Best then took an  international postdoctoral position at the University of Berne in Switzerland  where he studied cardiac muscle; and a second postdoctoral position at the  University of Chicago, where he studied calcium regulation in skeletal muscles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many  scientists, Best&rsquo;s interests were shaped by the world around him and led him  gradually to focus in more and more detail on a particular mechanism. Since  coming to the University of Illinois in 1979, Best has focused on characterizing and studying the regulation and function of voltage-dependent  ion channels. Ion channels are a complex of proteins with a main protein that  makes the pore or channel, and a cluster of auxiliary proteins or sub-units,  which modulate the behavior of the channel. As a group, these proteins are  involved in electrical signaling processes across cell membranes, making them  important in muscle contraction and nerve signaling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best is particularly focused  on those ion channels that are calcium selective. Calcium is an important  intracellular messenger whose movement into and within cells is regulated by  calcium channel proteins. Lately, Best&rsquo;s group has been investigating the  structure, function and physiological relevance of T-type, or low-voltage  activated, calcium channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate  goal of Best&rsquo;s laboratory is to take apart the protein complex that makes up  the calcium channel and understand what each subunit brings to the whole  operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best has  maintained this active research program despite also being head of the  Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology for the last decade. In  addition, he serves on a number of American Heart Association national panels.  Best is also a fellow of the American Heart Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a mentor,  Best believes students learn best when they are responsible for coming up with their  own idea or hypothesis. Students do this, he said, after learning the relevant  bench techniques by helping out on an ongoing project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;You can tell  you&rsquo;re successful with your students when they go in a direction you would  never have thought of; when they become colleagues,&rdquo; said Best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one case, one  of Best&rsquo;s students was looking at a different calcium channel that occurred,  not in skeletal muscle, but in heart muscle. She showed that the expression of  those channels varied during differentiation and growth. That finding intrigued  Best and inspired him to shift part of his research focus to the heart muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s following up on these interesting, new  observations that is cool,&rdquo; said Best, who jokes that he has changes directions  so often because he has a short attention span. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t work on the same thing  forever; I get excited about new findings. Those novel observations are so  exciting to me.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While basic  research may be Best&rsquo;s first love, he is gradually shifting into more  translational research. Best is hoping that further research on calcium channel  subunits might result in the design of a therapeutic agent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Biology is  changing, funding is changing, and both funding agencies and the general public  want more emphasis on more immediate benefit, which is completely  understandable,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Best&rsquo;s  transition reflects, in part, the realities of doing science research these  days, but he has no problem with that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I find the  research as engaging as it ever was, whether the goal is the understanding of a  basic biological mechanism or figuring out how to improve people&rsquo;s quality of  life,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other  hand, Best still is a research scientist at heart. &ldquo;If you bang away at the  fundamental mechanisms, that&rsquo;s how you make progress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Without a very  strong basic research program you will ultimately run out of new ideas that can  be translated into technical or clinical advances. And those new ideas depend  on a very vigorous, very active basic research community.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				  \r\n				  <p>As  department head, as well as an investigator in his own right and mentor to  young investigators, Best is doing his part to build and maintain that very  community. And, whether explaining how albatrosses soar, unraveling the  mysteries of ion channels, or reporting on his grandchildren&rsquo;s latest pranks,  Best&rsquo;s energy and enthusiasm are contagious.&nbsp;  That makes him a leader people are more than happy to follow.</p>','/images/best_phil_01.jpg',1,'2008-01-04 14:07:00','MCB	Physiology','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-01 14:28:50','2009-07-01 14:35:22','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(117,'Faculty Profile: Philip A.

The university didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;want any appearance of nepotism,&rdquo; she  remembers. &ldquo;Dual careers were unlikely options.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<img src=\"/images/2ndLevel/example1.jpg\" alt=\"dr. gillette\'s weekly lab meeting\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" id=\"right\" />\r\n			<p>				  Jim Heath, then the head of what is now  known as the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, gave Gillette  the title of visiting assistant professor.&nbsp;  Rhanor gave her some space and equipment in his lab and she set to work.</p>\r\n				<p>				  It is the rare creature indeed that can  begin as a visiting assistant professor and successfully leap the chasm from a  visiting position to a tenure-track one. But between her drive, her brains and,  she says, her luck, Gillette pulled it off. She now is not only a full  professor but has been head of the Department of Cell and Developmental Biology  for the last eight years. </p>\r\n				<p>				  In the beginning the Gillettes  collaborated on several successful projects and grants involving sea slug  neuroscience. Soon, however, a grant reviewer noted that &ldquo;If Mrs. Martha  Gillette thinks she deserves the princely sum of $18,000 , she better write her  own grants.&rdquo; </p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;That sum was not princely even then,&rdquo;  says Gillette with a grin. Still, the remark did get her attention and she  realized she needed to chart her own course, separate from Rhanor&rsquo;s. </p>\r\n				<p>				  Gillette brought her biochemical  understanding of how cells signal one another and applied that to examining the  body&rsquo;s biological clock in rats. The clockwork, it turns out, drives not only  circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness, but almost every function in any  living organism, including such functions as eating, drinking, body temperature  fluctuation and hormone secretion.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;What I totally love about clocks is that  they&rsquo;re so biological,&rdquo; says Gillette. &ldquo;They are so universal.&nbsp; Vast mats of blue green algae in the Pacific  Ocean have them; even single-celled organisms have them. Cells that have  six-hour division cycles can keep track of the 24-hour cycle. Clocks tell  plants when to flower, they tell migratory animals when to travel. Clocks tell  the liver when to make liver enzyme; and the clock in the brain (suprachiasmatic  nucleus, or SCN, in mammals) synchronizes the whole body.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  Most other researchers in the field of  biological clocks were doing experiments on live animals and treating the SCN  as a black box. Gillette, on the other hand, put a slice of the SCN in a  life-support dish and showed that it kept &ldquo;ticking&rdquo; for three days,  demonstrating that the clock was endogenous and not dependent on external  stimuli. Her work very soon became known as the &ldquo;clock in the dish.&rdquo; Later,  Gillette also became well known for deciphering the signal sent from the eye to  the clock.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;People really didn&rsquo;t know how the clock  worked,&rdquo; says Gillette. &ldquo;For example, how did light from the outside world  affect the internal clock? I was in the right place doing something unusual in  that field.&rdquo; </p>\r\n				<p>				  Gillette&rsquo;s first paper on the &ldquo;clock in  the dish&rdquo; was published in 1985. In 1986, she was promoted to visiting  associate professor, which came with a room of her own and the proper standing  to write her own grants.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;To succeed outside of the usual path,  you need opportunity&mdash;which means space and equipment. Rhanor really fostered my  success, at a time before people recognized I could be an asset. Art DeVries  also helped, offering me &ldquo;hot&rdquo; space to work with radioactivity,&rdquo; says  Gillette.</p>\r\n				<p>				  Because of the novelty of her approach, Gillette  started to receive research grants, which attracted students, which resulted in  papers. She began to make a name for herself and for her research. Still, as a  non-tenure track faculty member, Gillette was something of a stepchild in the  department. In the late 1980s, when two positions were posted, she applied for  both. One was molecular neuroscience and one was computational neuroscience.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I know I can be one of those,&rdquo; Gillette  remembers thinking. Although not the first choice for either position, Gillette  ended up getting the molecular neuroscience position in what is now Cell and  Developmental Biology and in the College of Medicine. </p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I never thought I wouldn&rsquo;t have a  position,&rdquo; she said with a huge grin. &ldquo;I was sure I was the right person for  the job.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  In 1990, 12 years after she arrived on  campus, Gillette was appointed associate professor, a tenured position. In  1993, she was named full professor. Today she not only heads the Department of  Cell and Developmental Biology, but also is a professor in the Department of  Molecular and Integrative Physiology, holds an appointment at the Institute for  Genomic Biology, and is an affiliate of the Beckman Institute. Gillette  collaborates extensively with colleagues across the campus and at other  institutions, something she especially enjoys.</p>\r\n				<p>				  True to her sunny disposition, Gillette  does not dwell on the struggles she faced. In fact, Gillette points out that  her route through academia&mdash;unconventional as it was&mdash;suited her, since she  had no worries about the &ldquo;tenure clock&rdquo; while she had small children at home.  And she enjoyed support, from her husband and friends, and the department  offered the opportunity to write for grants.</p>\r\n				<p>				  In turn, Gillette has provided support  for the numerous students, particularly women, who have come through her  laboratory. In 2004, she was awarded the Mika Salpeter Lifetime Achievement  Award by Women in Neuroscience at the Society for Neuroscience annual meeting  in recognition of her mentoring of numerous female medical scholars and  graduate and postdoctoral researchers.</p>\r\n				<p>				  Gillette also believes that her role as a  researcher requires her to help educate the public about the importance of  basic research. </p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;It is reasonable to a certain extent to  think about the applications of research and to demystify the connection  between research and medical advances,&rdquo; says Gillette. &ldquo;But there is no  question that the reason U.S. science has been pre-eminent for so long is its  investment in basic research science. Without that funding we will shortchange  ourselves and pay a big price 10 or 20 years from now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  Despite important responsibilities as an  administrator, mentor, and advocate, it is still basic research that makes  Gillette tick. She makes time for this passion by working at the bench in the  evenings and continuing to supervise her laboratory, which has eight doctoral  students, two postdoctoral fellows, one technician, and three undergraduates. </p>\r\n				<p>				  There are still so many things to  understand about the biological clock, says Gillette. For example, while the  SCN generates approximately 24-hour rhythms of physiology and behavior, those  oscillations are influenced by a dynamic cycle of neurochemical signals. In  fact, says Gillette, the image of the clock is not exactly accurate because the  mechanism is not a series of gears, but a dynamic system, always changing with  respect to what signals touch it. Unraveling those signals take much of  Gillette&rsquo;s attention. </p>\r\n				<p>				  In addition, some clocks interact with  one another, so if one is out of balance it can affect others. Circadian  rhythms, for example, are important in regulating sleep and so Gillette has  become expert in sleep disorders. Her group found out, for example, that sleep  centers in the brain can alter timing of the clock, possibly an effect of sleep  deprivation.</p>\r\n				<p>				  Recently, Gillette has been investigating  the idea that perhaps the signals that adjust the clock are the same that the  brain uses to make memories, which raises the interesting question of circadian  plasticity; that this may be a very fundamental mechanism that all cells use.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;There are still so many interesting  questions out there,&rdquo; she says with a grin.</p>','/images/2ndLevel/example1.jpg',1,'2006-11-01 14:41:00','MCB	CDB','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-01 14:44:10','2009-07-01 14:44:10','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(120,'Susan Lindquist: MCB Distinguished Lecturer','On October 3 at noon in the CLSL Auditorium (B102), the School of MCB sponsored a distinguished lecturer seminar by Susan Lindquist, PhD.

In one of those forks in the road of life, the  summer after her first year of medical school, Ceman found work in Robert  DeMars&rsquo; laboratory at the University of Wisconsin.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;It was a human genetics lab and I loved it,&rdquo; says Ceman. &ldquo;I  remember knowing, &lsquo;this is what I really, really want to do.&rsquo; We were working  on the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which is important is because it  drives your whole immune system. I thought the MHC was the coolest thing in the  world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  Switching from medical school to research in itself wasn&rsquo;t  difficult; Ceman loved research, but the finances were tricky.&nbsp;&ldquo;I had acquired this  huge debt and I wasn&rsquo;t even going to be a doctor and be able to pay it back,&rdquo;  she says. &ldquo;Still, it turned out okay, $17,000 later.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>Meanwhile,  Ceman  was having a great experience in DeMars&rsquo; lab.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;He was a fantastic mentor,&rdquo; says Ceman. &ldquo;I try to model my  own lab after our interactions. If something happens in lab and I&rsquo;m not sure  how to deal with it, I&rsquo;ll think, &lsquo;What would Bob do?&rsquo; He understood how to  interact with students and was very good at making you become the best  scientist you could be.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  After earning her doctorate, Ceman did two post-docs. First,  she went to the University of Chicago where she worked on the biochemistry of  the immune system. Ceman then moved to  Emory University in Atlanta, where she did a post-doc in a lab using a human  genetics approach.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I had become interested in Fragile X syndrome,&rdquo; she says.  &ldquo;When one gene is absent you get mental retardation, so I was thinking, if you  could just understand what that one gene did, you could understand higher  cognitive function. That was kind of na&iuml;ve I realize now, but that was my  motivator.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  To this day, there is much about Fragile X research that  Ceman finds compelling. Harking back to her pre-med days, Ceman likes that  there is a strong clinical application to her research. Many groups funding  Fragile X research are closely tied with family/patient advocacy and Ceman  enjoys interacting with the families.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I like the idea of knowing the complete disorder,&rdquo; says  Ceman. &ldquo;There are ways to interact with the families (at some meetings there is  a research track and a family track) and that has really made it very rich. I  look forward to taking my students to one of these family meetings in St. Louis  this year.&rdquo; </p>\r\n				<p>Ceman became a research assistant professor at Emory and  then joined the University of Illinois faculty in 2003. Although these are  tough times for young investigators because there are more and more labs  competing for fewer research dollars, Ceman is thriving. </p>\r\n				<p>				  It helps that Ceman has always loved to write and that she  has discovered a passion for teaching.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I love writing grants,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun. It gets you to  learn everything about a particular question.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  In addition to helping her write grants, Ceman&rsquo;s love of  writing and of telling a story, also has influenced her teaching, particularly  her course on medical genetics.</p>\r\n				<p>&ldquo;I love telling a story, which is where the teaching&mdash;has  really been a pleasure. Because I read about cancer or schizophrenia and then  in the classroom I tell the story.</p>\r\n				<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Plus, I identify  with the medical students,&rdquo; adds Ceman. &ldquo;I understand being smart, interested  in biology, wanting to help people. I know  exactly what they&rsquo;re going through so it&rsquo;s kind of fun to midwife that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n				<p>				  Neither doctor nor hippie, Ceman has instead found a way to  combine her love of biology, her curiosity about the way things work, and her  love of writing in a way she could not have envisioned, back when she built her  first heart.</p>\r\n				','/images/_JKL7433ceman04032007.jpg',1,'2007-09-01 14:50:00','MCB','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-01 14:52:56','2009-07-01 14:52:56','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(122,'Profile: Anne Carpenter','Anne Carpenter, MCB alumna and Imaging Platform Director for the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, was featured in a half-hour television documentary, Bold Visions: Women in Science and Technology.

Though the ovaries produce estrogen, research showed that embryos in mice with the ovaries removed still implanted successfully, suggesting the presence of estrogen produced in a different site. Looking for another source of estrogen, the researchers found an enzyme, P450 aromatase, in uterine tissues that converts testosterone to estrogen. Inhibiting this enzyme prevented implantation and blocked the critical differentiation and remodeling of uterine cells as well as vessel development. This newly discovered source of estrogen as a critical control mechanism explains several phenomena, including the inability of mice missing the aromatase gene to become pregnant even when supplied extra estrogen.

This planning process led to the dissolution of the School of Life Sciences and the formation of two new schools: Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) and Integrative Biology (IB). MCB encompasses the Departments of Biochemistry, Cell and Developmental Biology, Microbiology, and Molecular and Integrative Physiology. This reformation allowed a narrowing of scope and a deepening of coverage in the schools. Although officially established in 2000, the schools of MCB and IB have been operating for eleven years. The Class of 2004 was the first graduating class in Molecular and Cellular Biology. </p>\r\n<p>The MCB undergraduate curriculum is focused on the fundamental structures, functions, and mechanisms of living organisms. The MCB major provides a solid foundation in biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, microbiology, molecular genetics, physiology, and structural biology. Our program prepares students for various biomedical careers, and for medical, dental, veterinary, pharmacy, and graduate schools. MCB students may also choose to pursue traditional or nontraditional careers in education, industry, consulting, law, government, science writing, or other fields. Our courses cover recent scientific discoveries, many of which come from the work of our own faculty members—whom students have the opportunity to work with in both research lab and classroom settings. MCB majors also develop a strong foundation in math and physical sciences, reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of science today.</p>\r\n<p>MCB’s two majors—Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Specialized Curriculum in Biochemistry—are popular choices for university students interested in studying life from molecular through systems levels. These curricula prepare students for a vast array of vocations, as well as providing a solid groundwork for continuing education in an advanced or professional degree program. </p>\r\n<p>The majors’ uniquely structured curriculum style has proven highly effective for students. Undergraduate instruction combines creative instruction with hands-on laboratory experience. Required lab courses immerse students in experimental techniques—experience that is attractive to future employers. Outside of the required coursework track, students can earn course credit conducting research in faculty labs. <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20090715undergrad/pencilb.jpg\" alt=\"Student.\" width=\"200\" height=\"266\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"9\" align=\"right\" /></p>\r\n<p>Undergraduate instruction is overseen at the school level and the results have been wildly successful. This unified curriculum for undergraduates increases degree recognition among potential employers, broadening opportunities for graduates. Our graduates are highly technically proficient, thoroughly educated in the biological sciences, and have transferable laboratory skills (including the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation) that make them highly attractive to employers. Students’ participation in individual research labs has proven to be the educational experience that best prepares them for a career in science.</p>\r\n<p>With the creation of the MCB program, the core curriculum of biological science coursework required by all students was expanded from two semesters to five. This makes MCB unique among undergraduate programs. Our five-semester core—radically different from the typical two semesters of required coursework—allows for thorough and focused teaching of molecular and cellular biology. We found that even a three-semester core was insufficient to address how biology as a discipline has expanded. This led us to our current program, with a strong foundation of fundamentals which allows the students more flexibility to generalize or specialize with advanced courses in their last three semesters. </p>\r\n<p>MCB courses incorporate a variety of teaching styles. While larger core courses tend to be primarily lecture style, each includes an interactive and engaging discussion session where students are taught to problem-solve and think critically. Core laboratory courses ensure that each student has a hands-on, active experience in the laboratory. Students’ engagement and participation increase as they move into advanced level courses. This increase arises largely as a result of the integration of current topics and research into the curriculum. Students are able to see the importance and relevance of what they are learning, and apply their discoveries to real-world problems and issues.</p>\r\n<p>We offer a broad array of curricular enhancements, including undergraduate research opportunities, honors programs, advising and career workshops, living–learning communities, and MCB-specific education abroad opportunities. We enhance student success and growth by encouraging engagement in MCB, campus, and local community activities. Add to these opportunities strong core coursework and intensive laboratory experience, and you’ll see that our program is superlative.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20090715undergrad/class.jpg\" alt=\"Students.\" width=\"217\" height=\"144\" hspace=\"9\" vspace=\"9\" align=\"left\" />Our success is enviable. 94% of our students are in good academic standing (2.0 cumulative GPA / C average or higher). 72% have a 3.0 cumulative GPA / B average or higher. Over one third have a 3.5 or better! Our track record is a testament to the strength of teaching and support offered to students in our challenging curriculum. </p>\r\n<p>Transfer students or students who earn college credit for Advanced Placement (AP) biology courses in high school are usually unprepared for the rigor of advanced college-level biology. High school AP biology is a mixture of ecology, evolution, plant and animal biology, and varying levels of molecular and cellular biology. These topics are covered very broadly and lack the depth of our introductory courses in MCB.</p>\r\n<p>Because the way we teach biology is so unique—providing an in-depth focus on molecular genetics, and cellular and developmental biology during freshmen year—most high school students lack the appropriate foundation to waive our core MCB coursework. We try to encourage freshmen and their parents to look at high school AP biology credit as an experience that will help them be more successful students, and not to use it in place of MCB courses.</p>\r\n<p>Another challenge is helping students understand that their undergraduate experience is not a race. The first one done doesn’t necessarily win—in fact students who stay for the entire four years gain valuable experiences (undergrad research, study abroad, leadership experience, community involvement) that can help them with their future aspirations. We encourage students to think about their general education and elective selections as a way to work on areas in which they need improvement—to expand their comfort zone. Students should choose advanced MCB electives based on their interests and long-term goals.</p>\r\n<p>Students can underestimate what is required to be a successful scholar. We try to instill good time management and study skills in our students. They leave our program as independent problem solvers who work well both individually and in groups. </p>\r\n<p> <img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20090715undergrad/graph.gif\" alt=\"Chart.\" width=\"245\" height=\"172\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"right\" />The number of students enrolling continues to increase, and the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology continues to improve its curricula even as it is increasingly challenged by economic developments. In order to advance our mission, even as campus resources diminish, we continue to look outside the University for continued support. Additional lecture, lab, and discussion rooms along with specialized spaces for student interaction and learning outside the classroom would greatly benefit our students. Other ongoing needs include the acquisition or replacement of instructional laboratory equipment, and direct support for students interested in enhancing their learning experience by working in one of the many MCB research laboratories.</p>\r\n<p>The MCB undergraduate curriculum is designed to impart both the core principles of modern biology and conceptual and analytical skills necessary for a successful scientific career. Focused educational and practical training in molecular and cellular biology prepares students for professional and graduate schools, and many other exciting career paths. </p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20090715undergrad/tallT.A.jpg',1,'2009-07-16 12:37:00','MCB','Feature','gillespi','2009-07-15 15:38:46','2009-07-16 13:44:57','William Gillespie',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(126,'The MCB Undergraduate Experience: A Q&A for New Students  and Parents from an MCB Graduate','Outgoing MCB senior Alex Crofts takes a few minutes to provide an informal report, responding to questions about his time at MCB. ','<p><b>Outgoing MCB senior Alex Crofts takes a few minutes to provide an informal report, responding to questions about his time at MCB. </b>\r\n<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n<strong><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/QACrofts/1.jpg\" alt=\"Students.\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"left\" />Q: How accessible are professors  to undergraduate students?<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n</strong>  Professors teaching MCB courses make themselves&nbsp;  accessible to their students in several ways, in order to meet the students\'  instructional needs.&nbsp; Professors hold office hours at least once a  week, and normally make extra time for students before an exam. Thanks to how  the class schedules are arranged, rarely do you encounter a professor  availability problem . If you need help on your homework, chances are the professor  has scheduled open office hours between the date the homework is assigned and  the date it is due. Any drawbacks from being in  a large lecture can be negated by the  experience of talking one-on-one with a professor during office hours—it is the  best interaction you could want with your professor. If there aren\'t office hours available before your homework is  due, there is usually a required small group  discussion class that can help with any problems. In case you can’t make it to office hours, professors reply to emails in a  respectful and timely fashion, and a surprisingly large number of professors are happy to talk  answer student questions by telephone.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Large lecture courses are often run in a way that  minimizes the need to see the professor in any  case. Lecture notes are provided for almost every lecture, or are  available online. Supplemental or required reading in text books help reinforce  concepts taught in class, and weekly online quizzes help keep students on track. Few students  consistently visit the professor’s office hours every week, simply because  there is often no need.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  One of the great things about the undergraduate student body is their universal  academic strength. You can often seek help from your peers just as confidently  as you can from the TA or professor. If I had a  question about course material I would always ask a friend or TA first—I’d save  the really tough questions for the professor.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Professors know how their students are feeling, and, if a big issue comes up,  it is quickly addressed in lecture to avoid confusion. In short, classes are  designed to avoid problems only the professor can help solve, and professors  are available for those students who need them.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  <strong><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/QACrofts/5.jpg\" alt=\"Students.\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"right\" />Q: Do you feel engulfed or made insignificant by the hugeness of the  university?<br />\r\n  </strong><br />\r\n  The University of Illinois is only as big as you make it. Yes, classes might be  a ten minute walk apart, and yes, you may have to take a bus to get from one  building to another efficiently. However, the physical space is often not an  obstacle for students—it’s the large number of  fellow students that can make some uncomfortable.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Although this is a well-known tip, its effectiveness cannot be  underestimated—sitting in the front row of a large lecture hall diminishes any  feeling of insignificance. The professor makes eye contact with you, sees you  every day you come to class, and you avoid noticing the sea of students sitting  behind you. You’ll also be the first student to ask the professor a question  after class simply due to your proximity. \r\n  Most large lectures have a mandatory discussion section in a standard  classroom, which helps prevent the feeling of being lost in the crowd. \r\n  You can be in constant contact with your TA and visit the professor after every  lecture or during their office hours, allowing you to connect with the teaching  staff.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Although all of this helps the feeling of being lost or insignificant, the best  way to avoid those feelings is to make and maintain a group of friends within  your major.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Sitting with your friends at every lecture may seem like it can only lead to  distraction, and even if it does, the benefits far outweigh any negatives. Your  friends can serve many important functions that the professor or TA can’t.  Meeting up with your friends is an encouragement to actually attend a lecture,  and allows you to quietly discuss any questions that arise during the lecture.  Outside of class you keep each other on task: ­“Hey, remember we have that quiz  on Friday? Want to study tonight?” Your friends are also people who will have  the same feelings as you. Having someone to complain about a hard exam with,  warn about a boring discussion class this week, or to give you  student-to-student advice on what classes to take is psychologically  invaluable.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Further, lab courses (which can last up to four hours long) use a partner  system, which allows you to work together and spend time with your peers. Lab  and discussion sections give you plenty of opportunities to meet and work with  your fellow MCB majors, and help you feel more like part of a group. Running  into my old lab partners on the quad was always fun, and I knew I could call  them if I needed help on any material.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Also, upper-level classes, which deal with the most difficult material, are  small and very student-professor oriented. When I took Microbial Physiology as  a senior, the class was under twenty students and taught by a microbiology  professor in a small classroom. The truth is, large lectures work because the  level of material they cover is appropriate to teach to a large group of  students. The more advanced the material, the smaller the class size.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  <strong><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/QACrofts/6.jpg\" alt=\"Students.\" width=\"200\" height=\"133\" hspace=\"6\" vspace=\"6\" align=\"left\" />Q: What do you think the ideal level of involvement is, if any, for a parent  to have with their child’s undergraduate experience?<br />\r\n  </strong><br />\r\n  Parents have the gift of perspective. Every student comes across a hard  chemistry or physics exam, and can feel down in the dumps about their academic  abilities—it’s easy for students to make typical things into a catastrophe.  Parents can understand that one exam is just that: one exam out of 100+ exams  the student will most likely have during their undergraduate career. Staying  positive and encouraging the student to try their best is more helpful than any  direct influence a parent could have with teaching staff or advisers.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Parents should try their best to distinguish what they want for their student  (“Wouldn’t that be great if she became a doctor?”) and what suits their  strengths the best (“Mom/Dad, I’m getting A’s in all my English courses but I  got a D+ on my last physiology exam…”). Encouraging them to pursue what they’re  interested in, while keeping in perspective what they can do with that gained  knowledge after graduation, is key. Maybe science journalism is a good  compromise between this student’s interest in biology and success in English? A  student might get tunnel vision heading down particular academic routes, and  parents can help them see the big picture and suggest they explore every option  they have at the university. Let your students explore different areas while always keeping a path for the future in mind.

The  advisers are open to any and all questions pertaining to academics or your career goals, and can  offer suggestions on where to look for personal or emotional help. They are  also very good at helping you organize your time and study habits.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Extensive personal help and counseling can be found in the university dormitories  freshman and sophomore students typically live in. The staff actively builds up  a feeling of community and offers opportunities to get to know other students  and dissolve stereotypes and social barriers. The dorm I lived in freshman year  planned cookouts and day trips to Chicago, games on the quad, and offered  coffee and snacks at night during finals week.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n  Little things like confiding in your peers or taking advantage of planned  student-run events can really help you feel part of the campus community. Students  should get involved in student groups and campus-sanctioned activities. There  are also a number of intramural sports available for all students to help keep  them active and meet new people.

With a total of 8  required laboratory courses (3 chemistry, 2 physics, 3 biology) on top of the  required MCB lecture/discussion courses, there is a lot to learn and a lot to  do. There are a variety of upper-level classes to explore during your junior  and senior year, so you can take classes on the material that interests you the  most.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\nI always felt lucky that this major offered a lot of hands-on experience. While  other majors are dominated by lectures, discussions, and papers, MCB utilizes  laboratory courses to mix it up. You learn something in lecture and then  actually apply it in your laboratory class. Instead of writing term papers, you  have lab write-ups discussing the data you got from your own experiment in the  lab. It’s an interactive way of learning that isn’t found in most other majors.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p class=\"small\"><a name=\"1\" id=\"1\"></a>1.  It is important for parents to keep the lines of communication open with\r\ntheir student.  Taking a constructive and non-judgmental interest in\r\ntheir activities, course work and grades can help to provide a student\r\nwith much-needed support. The university adheres to the guidelines of the\r\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), so faculty and staff\r\nare not permitted to discuss a student\'s educational record without the\r\nstudent\'s written permission.  The best way to learn about your student\'s\r\nprogress is by talking to him or her.  Encourage your student to be open\r\nand honest with you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a name=\"2\" id=\"12\"></a>2.

Implantation is a complex process driven by a cascade of cellular signaling events regulated by maternal hormones. Failure of the fertilized embryo to implant into the uterus is a major cause of infertility, a public health issue. The scientists at this center will employ innovative investigative strategies to explore the cellular pathways that control maternal-fetal interactions during implantation and to identify factors that underlie infertility in women suffering from endometriosis, a common gynecologic disorder. In subjects with endometriosis, the endometrial tissue grows in locations other than its normal environment of the uterus, causing pelvic pain and infertility. Endometriosis is reported to affect approximately 15% of reproductive age women, and is observed in 30–40% of women with infertility. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The knowledge gained from these studies will have a direct impact on women’s health by helping to develop new molecular diagnostic tools for screening endometrial dysfunction, and enabling targeted therapeutic strategies for the treatment of infertility. \r\n  </p>\r\n<p>The program comprises four complementary, synergistic projects: three basic research projects at the University of Illinois (led by Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Milan Bagchi, Swanlund Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Benita Katzenellenbogen, and Professor of Veterinary Biosciences Indrani Bagchi), and one clinical project at the Emory University School of Medicine (Atlanta, GA) led by Dr. Robert Taylor. The University of Illinois research team also includes Dr. Yuechao Zhao, a postdoctoral trainee in molecular and integrative physiology, who has recently joined the center. </p>\r\n<img src=\"/features/20090801repro/microscope.jpg\" alt=\"Milan Bagchi.\" align=\"left\" vspace=\"9\" hspace=\"9\" /><p>The three basic research projects at the University of Illinois will address cellular mechanisms underlying implantation, using the mouse as a model system. The lead uterine factors that are found to be critical for implantation in the mouse model will be tested in human endometrial tissues, provided by the Emory group, to evaluate whether the same factors operate in the human. In this collaboration, investigators will examine whether these pathways operate in an aberrant manner in endometrial tissue obtained from individuals suffering from endometriosis. </p>\r\n<p>Collectively, these researchers are working together to understand the molecular basis of human infertility associated with endometrial dysfunction. The center’s program, which serves as a foundation for the professional development of young scientists wishing to pursue careers in important areas of women’s health and infertility research, is also an excellent model for the University’s current mission of enhancing translational research in biology. </p>\r\n<p>The research in this Center is supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through a cooperative agreement as part of the Specialized Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research. The Center also receives generous institutional support from the Office of the Vice Chancellor of Research, the School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, and the College of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.</p>\r\n<p>Results from these studies should improve understanding of the mechanisms and cellular pathways that control implantation and help identify factors that underlie infertility in women with endometriosis.

Leibson, professor of  immunology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and a pre-eminent researcher  of NK cells died of cancer on August 6, 2007.</p><img src=\"/alumni/images/PaulJLeibson.jpg\" alt=\"paulliebson\" width=\"200\" height=\"274\" id=\"right\" />\r\n          <p class=\"small\">Paul grew up in the Chicago area in  a large cohesive family with strong intellectual traditions that did not  confuse the importance of goodness of heart with the glamour of academic  accomplishments. After graduating magna cum laude in 1974 with a BS in Honors Biology  from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign he earned his PhD in immunology  from the University of Chicago. He received his predoctoral training in tumor  immunology in the laboratory of Hans Schreiber and earned a PhD in 1979 and an MD  with honors in 1981.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">After a pediatric internship and  residency at the University of Colorado in Denver, Paul trained for two years  as a fellow in allergy-immunology with Anthony R. Hayward at the National  Jewish Hospital and Research Center, where he began his work on human NK cells.  He joined Mayo Clinic in 1986 for a distinguished career in  immunology. During two decades at Mayo he poured himself into teaching in the  classroom and laboratory, serving for five years as Dean of the Graduate School.  His colleagues at Mayo recognized Paul  for his service in research and teaching with the Rose M. and Morris Eisenberg  Professorship and he was named Mayo Distinguished Educator for his truly  premier mentoring of students, fellows, and junior faculty alike.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">The name of Paul Leibson is  unquestionably linked to NK cell signaling. Together with a small group of  courageous scientists, he pioneered this field well before the characterization  of NK cell receptors that trigger cell-mediated cytotoxicity. It was typical  for the signaling section of each NK workshop to begin with a state-of-the-art  presentation by Paul. For those who are not in the field of signaling, Paul&rsquo;s  work is essential reading. This line of research took a certain amount of faith  and courage, in that the receptors that mediate one form of NK cell-mediated  killing (antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or ADCC) are only partially  defined, while the second mechanism of target cell recognition, which leads to  the &lsquo;natural&rsquo; killing of tumor cells, has been a complete mystery. Paul left  the critical work of receptor characterization to other equally skilled natural  killer cell biologists, and concentrated instead on how these receptors deliver  NK cell-activating signals from the plasma membrane to the cytotoxic effector  machinery in NK cells.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">His body of work in the 1990s spans  an array of important signaling enzymes, ranging from tyrosine kinases such as  Lck and Syk, to the small, Ras-related GTPases, to the lipid-metabolizing  enzymes, namely the phospholipase C-gamma-1 and -2 isoforms and  phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Paul&rsquo;s string of publications in the 1990s offer  some truly provocative insights into the inner workings of one of the more  mysterious cells in the immune system. More recently, he dedicated his efforts  in understanding how single NK cell receptors branch out into diverse signaling  pathways rather than a single pathway. As a result, he demonstrated that NKG2D  could trigger phosphoinositide release  and small GTPase activation through a single non-ITAM containing adaptor,  DAP10, which can recruit PI-3K and the Grb2-Vav complex. Paul\'s work did not  always focus on positive signaling networks regulating NK cell-mediated  killing. In fact, his laboratory was among the first to demonstrate that the  expression of MHC molecules on target cells could inhibit cellular cytotoxicity  by blocking the most proximal step in the signaling cascade, namely activation  of the src kinase Lck. He subsequently went on to show, following identification  of killer inhibitory receptors (KIR), that the mechanism of their inhibitory  property was due to recruitment of tyrosine phosphatase Shp-1 to the KIR  cytoplasmic tail. </p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">In sharp contrast with other investigators in the field of  signaling, he focused on human cells rather than mouse, reaching the same level  of experimental sophistication achieved using genetically targeted mice.  Indeed, his studies often preceded mouse studies and provided an accurate  framework for the interpretation of the results obtained in mouse models. Paul  fully recognized and acknowledged the value of studies in mice, but, perhaps  due to his clinical background, remained devoted to freshly isolated human NK  cell lines and cultured NK cell clones as models for the functional  characterization of these fascinating cells of the immune system. His devotion  to human cells came with a price. Members of the Department of Immunology were  systematically tested for the quality of their NK cells and the ability of  their serum to support the growth of his human NK cell clones. Those who passed  either test often found themselves on the receiving end of a large  needle-bearing syringe manned by the good doctor himself. However, it should be  stated that Paul would not ask others to volunteer for a duty that he would not  carry out himself. There is no doubt that, what we know today on NK cell  signaling, is largely due to Paul Leibson\'s impressive work and knowledge. His  work and ideas in the NK field will continue to be influential.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">Paul was one of the most positive  people we ever met. He showed us that every day&mdash;in fact every situation of life&mdash;is  full of new and wonderful opportunities. However, he was extremely careful not  to confuse optimism with reality. Instead, Paul was uncompromising in his determination to stand for truth. He  loathed situations where the truth was hidden or distorted and refused to serve  in situations where this guiding principle was not honored. He was truly a man  of impeccable integrity. His genuine enormous curiosity in science did not impair his  ability to analyze experimental results most stringently and objectively, but  helped him to ask motivating questions and to propose elegant experiments in  the kindest most considered way possible. Similarly,  his genuine, deep, and cordial friendship extended to so many of us would never  ignore a problem but focus on opportunities and solutions, often in a very  humorous way. It is no wonder that the legendary camping trips he did with  students, colleagues, and family were often most perfect even when it rained.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">Paul enthusiastically greeted his friends. He treated each visitor that  came to his office with genuine enthusiasm&hellip;making them feel at the center of  his universe. Paul loved his family, his friends, and his work. Each was  properly placed in his priorities with a remarkable balance. He was always  happy to come to work and then to go home to his family. Thus, in addition to research and  education, his passions included cooking and learning about wine, and gathering  for lively discussions and story telling with family and friends. His love for  nature nurtured his enthusiasm for gardening, camping, mushroom hunting, and  traveling. Paul is survived by  his wife Cynthia, daughter Sarah Bryan (Sean), and two brothers, David and  Marc. His parents Ruth and Benton preceded him in death.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">Despite losing his  courageous struggle with a most aggressive, unbearable cancer that claimed his  life much too early, Paul considered himself blessed, blessed by having a  loving wife, daughter, brothers, and other family, friends and colleagues, and  having had marvelous parents that all were so dear to his heart.</p>\r\n          <p class=\"small\">Engraved on the entrance arch of the  library of Paul Leibson&rsquo;s alma mater, a motto reads <em>&quot;Non est mortuus qui scientiam vivificavit&quot;</em> or &quot;No one is dead who  has given life to knowledge.&quot;</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/alumni/images/PaulJLeibson.jpg',1,'2007-08-07 20:24:00','MCB','Feature','gillespi','2009-08-07 20:27:01','2009-08-07 20:29:35','Hans Schreiber and Vinay Kumar',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(135,'Welcoming Dr. Eric Bolton and Dr. Hee Jung Chung','Dr. Eric Bolton and Dr. Hee Jung Chung have accepted offers to join the MCB faculty in the Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology.

','In new papers appearing in October in Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), University of Illinois biochemistry professor Raven H. Huang and his colleagues describe the first RNA repair system to be discovered in bacteria. This is only the second RNA repair system discovered to date (with two proteins from T4 phage, a virus that attacks bacteria, as the first). The novelty of the newly discovered bacterial RNA repair system is that, before the damaged RNA is sealed, a methyl group is added to the two-prime hydroxyl group at the cleavage site of the damaged RNA, making it impossible to cleave the site again. Thus, the repaired RNA is “better than new.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis discovery has implications for protecting cells against ribotoxins, a class of toxins that kills cells by cleaving essential RNAs involved in protein translation. Because the enzyme responsible for methylation in the newly-discovered RNA repair system is the Hen1 homolog in bacteria, the discovery has also implications for the understanding of RNA interference and gene expression in plants, animals, and other eukaryotes. The eukaryotic Hen1 is one of three enzymes (along with Dicer and Argonaute) essential for the generation of small non-coding RNAs of 19-30 nucleotides in RNA interference.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhile the Science paper describes the mechanism of the entire RNA repair process, the article in PNAS focuses on the chemistry of methylation reaction, specifically the crystal structure of the methyltransferase domain of bacterial Hen1. Because the eukaryotic Hen1 carries out the same chemical reaction, the study should further understanding of RNA interference in eukaryotic organisms.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAccording to Professor Huang, “Hen1 is one of three essential enzymes in generating small noncoding RNAs for RNA interference in eukaryotes. We found out that Hen1 homologs exists in bacteria, but bacteria have no RNA interference. Therefore, we were very curious to find out what bacterial Hen1 is used for.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“Our studies demonstrated that bacterial Hen1 carries out the same chemical reaction as its counterpart in eukaryotes, which was not surprising. What surprised us was that, instead of involvement in RNA interference, the bacterial Hen1 is part of a RNA repair and modification system. And Hen1 is responsible for producing the repaired RNA that is ‘better than new.’”','',1,'2009-10-12 13:00:00','MCB	Biochem','News','gillespi','2009-10-12 18:52:51','2009-10-12 18:54:33','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(142,'Roger Adams Lab Ribbon Cutting','A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held Friday October 9th to celebrate the completion of phase one of the renovations of historic university building Roger Adams Laboratory.

Here, we report that FXR is a target of SIRT1, a deacetylase that mediates nutritional and hormonal modulation of hepatic metabolism. Lysine 217 of FXR is the major acetylation site targeted by p300 and SIRT1. Acetylation of FXR increases its stability but inhibits heterodimerization with RXR&alpha;, DNA binding, and transactivation activity. Downregulation of hepatic SIRT1 increased FXR acetylation with deleterious metabolic outcomes. Surprisingly, in mouse models of metabolic disease, FXR interaction with SIRT1 and p300 was dramatically altered, FXR acetylation levels were elevated, and overexpression of SIRT1 or resveratrol treatment reduced acetylated FXR levels. Our data demonstrate that FXR acetylation is normally dynamically regulated by p300 and SIRT1 but is constitutively elevated in metabolic disease states. Small molecules that inhibit FXR acetylation by targeting SIRT1 or p300 may be promising therapeutic agents for metabolic disorders.\r\n</blockquote>','',1,'2009-11-03 22:04:00','MCB	Physiology','News','gillespi','2009-11-03 22:09:38','2009-11-03 22:12:16','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(148,'Carvedilol Shown to have Unique Characteristics Among Beta Blockers','In a new study, Kevin Xiang and colleagues report that a class of heart medications called beta-blockers can have a helpful, or harmful, effect on the heart, depending on their molecular activity.\r\n\r\nThe study, which appears in the journal Circulation Research, found that beta-blockers that target both the alpha- and beta-receptors on the heart muscle offer the most benefit to cardiac patients, while those that target only the beta-receptors can actually undermine the structure and function of the heart.','In a new study, Kevin Xiang and colleagues report that a class of heart medications called beta-blockers can have a helpful, or harmful, effect on the heart, depending on their molecular activity.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe study, which appears in the journal <i>Circulation Research,</i> and which has been selected for comment by Faculty of 1000 Biology, found that beta-blockers that target both the alpha- and beta-receptors on the heart muscle offer the most benefit to cardiac patients, while those that target only the beta-receptors can actually undermine the structure and function of the heart.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nCirculation Research is published by the American Heart Association.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with heart disease usually have higher levels of catecholamines – hormones that activate the beta-adrenergic receptors to stimulate cardiac muscle contraction. In this process, the heart initially grows to become a more efficient pump.  Unfortunately, the researchers found, this growth also predisposes the heart to eventual failure.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nTraditionally, beta-blockers targeting the beta-adrenergic receptors have been utilized as a long-term therapy for heart failure.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nInterestingly, blocking adrenergic receptors has been widely used clinically for nearly 50 years without a full understanding of the molecular consequences of these drugs, said co-author and graduate student David Cervantes. Kevin Xiang, a professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the University of Illinois led the study. The research team also included researcher Catherine Crosby.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nA previous study in 2003 showed that the beta-blocker carvedilol produced a greater survival benefit than another drug, metoprolol tartrate. Carvedilol targets both the beta- and alpha-adrenergic receptors.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe new study unveiled an elegant intracellular signaling system in which beta-receptor activation modulates alpha-adrenergic signaling. It showed that blocking the beta-receptor alone promotes cardiac remodeling via growth of cardiac fibroblasts induced by alpha-adrenergic receptor signaling. The growth of fibroblasts in the heart further damages the integrity and function of the heart.<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis observation suggests that the use of carvedilol in combination with inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE inhibitors) may be of the greatest benefit to cardiac patients, and has significant clinical implications on which beta-blockers patients should take.<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\"I think this is really good stuff,\" Xiang says. \"It\'s a surprise project. It\'s not what we initially intended looking into. But it\'s a very nice, elegant study and a very beautiful cellular mechanism. It definitely will help people along the way to understand how to further manipulate this system. Beta blockers are still the most commonly used drug for heart disease.\"\r\n ','',1,'2009-11-19 22:21:00','MCB	Physiology','News','gillespi','2009-11-19 22:23:13','2009-12-17 16:19:11','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(149,'Jonsook Kim Kemper Paper Selected by Faculty of 1000','\"Bile acid signaling pathways increase stability of Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation,\" published this year in <i>Genes Dev.</i>, has been selected as a Faculty of 1000 recommended article of the year.','A paper co-authored by Associate Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Jonsook Kim Kemper, \"Bile acid signaling pathways increase stability of Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) by inhibiting ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation,\" published this year in <i>Genes Dev.</i>, has been selected as a Faculty of 1000 recommended article of the year.

Rachel Whitaker, a member of the biocomplexity theme at IGB and assistant professor of microbiology, studies gene sequences to answer other kinds of questions. She would like to know, for example, \"How do microbes, specifically Archaea, evolve? Is the system by which they evolve different or similar to eukaryotes or to bacteria?\" Ultimately the answers to some of these questions may give researchers insight into what Whitaker calls \"deep, open questions about microbial evolution, the most fundamental of which is, how did all of this diversity come to be?\"\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20091210whitaker/rwhitaker2.jpg\">\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe trick is, instead of comparing, for example, the shape of finch beaks, like Darwin did, Whitaker is looking at Archaea, which do not have distinctive physical characteristics.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"Those studying the evolution of \'charismatic macrofauna\' have the theory, statistical methods and tools,\" says Whitaker. \"We\'re trying to adapt those tools to microbial systems.\"\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThis involves comparing sequences across a particular microbe. In Whitaker\'s case that microbe is <i>Sulfolobus islandicus</i>, which was one of the relatively few Archaea that had been cultured and sequenced when she was in graduate school at University of California, Berkeley. This Archaea thrives in volcanic hot springs of Yellowstone National Park and the Kamchatka Peninsula.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nScientists had assumed that microbes, in part because they are so small and abundant, did not fit the conventional model of evolution in which physical barriers led to distinct species. The discovery that some microbes in far corners of the world have identical 16S rRNA sequences supported this \"everything is everywhere\" model. Scientists interpreted this as all microbes exist in every location but thrive only in certain environmental conditions.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWhitaker set out to test this assumption by looking at whether there were, in fact, physical barriers that resulted in distinct <i>Sulfolobus</i> populations. In order to gather more data, she collected strains from three geographically distinct areas &#8212; Yellowstone National Park, Kamchatka Peninsula, and Lassen National Park (in northeastern California) &#8212; and sequenced their entire genomes before they could mutate in the lab.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\"With more data, like with a microscope, you can zoom in and see more detail,\" says Whitaker.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWith complete sequences of eight <i>Sulfolobus islandicus</i> strains from three sites Whitaker was able to determine whether the populations were genetically the same or different. If they were the same that would support the \"everything is everywhere\" model; if they were different that would support the idea that microbes evolve and provide evidence for allopatric speciation, à la finch beaks. Whitaker\'s findings indicate that the Kamchatka Peninsula strain is, indeed, different from the Yellowstone <i>Sulfolobus</i>. In addition, all the strains from Yellowstone are more closely related to each other than to the Kamchatka strains. These findings, which have been published in both <i>Science</i> and in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</i> suggest that the Archaea are, in fact, distinct by geographic location and that geographical isolation plays a significant role in the evolution of Archaea.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWhitaker first became interested in Archaea and microbial diversity in 1997 after reading an article in <i>Science</i> by Norman Pace, titled \"A Molecular View of Microbial Diversity and the Biosphere.\" In that paper Pace advocated for the kind of \"microbial naturalism\" approach Whitaker is taking. Few other microbiologists have pursued this direction, in part because the questions it poses are complex, the experiments are difficult to design, and the results can be difficult to interpret.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Whitaker perseveres. Her most recent projects have focused on the discovery that, while <i>Sulfolobus</i> is rapidly changing genetic material, that material is coming, not from other Archaea or even Bacteria, but from viruses and plasmids.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n\"Viruses and plasmids are clearly what is important, they are what is driving Archaea to evolve,\" says Whitaker. \"Studying viruses and plasmids is difficult and frustrating but very exciting.\" Whitaker has recently noticed that the greatest variation among <i>Sulfolobus islandicus</i> strains is in a section of the genome called CRISPR, a recently discovered microbial immune system. Understanding the CRISPR is a new and emerging field.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nWhitaker\'s lab is now looking at how the CRISPR evolves in <i>Sulfolobus islandicus</i> and how that evolution affects both the host and the virus or plasmid. Whitaker\'s lab is seeking to determine the extent that the biogeographic distribution of elements like viruses and plasmids is determined by the biogeography of its hosts.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nHaving spent the summer at Yellowstone collecting samples, Whitaker and her students have hundreds of strains to be purified, amplified and sequenced. With more samples, Whitaker will be better able to pursue her line of questioning.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nIn another project, Whitaker is looking at the microbial population ecology of temperate lakes in northern Wisconsin to see how water disturbances affect archaeal diversity. She has found that each lake has a slightly different set of Archaea, specifically methanogens, each on its own evolutionary trajectory. Lake mixing, says Whitaker, does not seem to be the driver of that evolution or of the diversity, so there is much more to be learned about how and why Archaea evolve. Whitaker is passionate about helping to lead the charge.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe other members of the biocomplexity theme and of IGB as a whole are an enormous boost to her efforts, says Whitaker. \"Every time I go to the IGB I get excited about new ideas,\" she says. \"By asking questions across lines of research it stimulates people to have new ideas, and those ideas are big and interdisciplinary.

biology professor Lisa Stubbs (right) and postdoctoral researcher Katja Nowick and their colleagues found distinct differences in gene activity between humans and chimps. These differences are associated with about 90 transcription factors, they found.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20091209stubbs/stubbs_lisa500.jpg\" />\r\n<p style=\"font-size:10px\">Cell and developmental biology professor Lisa Stubbs (right) and postdoctoral researcher Katja Nowick</p>\r\n<p class=\"small\">The study, in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that broad differences in the gene activity of humans and of chimpanzees, affecting nearly 1,000 genes, appear to be linked to the action of about 90 transcription factors. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nTranscription factors are proteins that bind to specific regions of the DNA to promote or repress the activity of many genes. A single transcription factor can spur the transcription of dozens of genes into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into proteins that do the work of the cell. This allows specific organs or tissues to quickly ramp up a response to an environmental change or internal need.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nPrevious studies have found differences in gene expression between humans and chimps, particularly in the brain. Genes involved in metabolism or protein transport, for example, are translated into mRNAs at a much higher level in human brains than in the smaller brains of chimpanzees.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis makes sense, said University of Illinois cell and developmental biology professor Lisa Stubbs, who led the new analysis with postdoctoral researcher Katja Nowick.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“These differences fit what we know because the human brain is so much larger and proteins need to be shuttled a long way out to the synapses,” Stubbs said. “A higher requirement for metabolic energy has also been demonstrated independently for human brains.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhat wasn’t clear from previous studies was how this upsurge in gene activity was coordinated, she said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nStubbs has had a longtime interest in the evolutionary role of transcription factors and other regulatory agents in the genome. She is particularly interested in the largest family of transcription factors in mammals, the KRAB zinc finger (KRAB-ZNF) genes, which on average have accumulated more differences in sequence between humans and chimps than other genes.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“There are a lot of unique new transcription factors that arise in this family,” Stubbs said. “And they arise by duplication of older genes. So the genes make a new copy of themselves and then that new copy takes on a slightly different or even dramatically different function.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“Our very strong bias is to believe that these transcription factors are involved in speciation and traits that make species unique,” she said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNowick, who studies human and primate evolution, was part of a team (at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, in Leipzig, Germany) that analyzed differences in gene expression between humans and chimps.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the new study, Nowick and computer scientist Tim Gernat, a co-author, took a new look at data from that study, which tracked gene expression – including genes coding for transcription factors – in tissues from six humans and five chimpanzees.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“Katja and Tim came up with a strategy for cleaning up the data and looking at these genes more uniquely,” Stubbs said. “It hadn’t been done before.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe analysis revealed a broad pattern of activity in 90 transcription factors that paralleled the activity of about 1,000 genes in humans and chimps.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe KRAB-ZNF genes were the most common members of this group, but many other transcription factors were also involved. Some were activators and some were repressors, but their activity coincided with a general upsurge of these genes in human brains.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEivind Almaas, a researcher at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and a co-author on the study, developed a gene regulatory network diagram of the transcription factors in relation to the genes that rise or fall with them. The proximity of one transcription factor to another in the network depended on the degree of overlap of the lists of genes that correlate with each. Almaas created one network diagram for humans and another for chimps, and uncovered some interesting differences.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The chimp network looks very much like the human one except there are a few transcription factors in different positions and with different connectivity,” Stubbs said. “Those are of interest from the point of view that they signal a major gene regulatory shift between species, and this shift may help us explain some of the biological differences.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe new findings indicate that certain transcription factors are working together in a coordinated way to regulate the changes in seen in gene expression between humans and chimps, the researchers said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“Once this network of transcription factors is established, changes in the network can be amplified because transcription factors control other genes,” Nowick said. “Even a small change in transcription factor expression can therefore produce a large effect on overall gene expression differences between chimpanzees and humans.”</P>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20091209stubbs/stubbs_lisa300.jpg',1,'2009-12-09 16:43:00','MCB	CDB','Feature','gillespi','2009-12-09 16:53:37','2010-02-24 13:52:08','Diana Yates',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(153,'Morrissey and Colleagues Further Unravel Mysteries of Thrombosis','In a new study published in <i>Cell,</i> and rated \"exceptional\" by the Faculty of 1000 Biology, Professor of Biochemistry Jim Morrissey and colleagues have determined that polyphosphate, an inorganic polymer of phosphate, secreted by human platelets is an important link in thrombotic diseases and inflammation.','In a new study published in <i>Cell,</i> and rated \"exceptional\" by the Faculty of 1000 Biology, Professor of Biochemistry Jim Morrissey and colleagues have determined that polyphosphate, an inorganic polymer of phosphate secreted by human platelets, is an important link in thrombotic diseases and inflammation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe three authors of the study from Dr. James Morrissey’s group at the University of Illinois had previously demonstrated, in a paper appearing in <i>The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</i> in 2006, that polyphosphate triggers blood clotting via the contact pathway, one of two known pathways for initiating clotting.  The contact pathway is dispensable for hemostasis, the normal clotting process that stops bleeding following injury. On the other hand, the contact pathway was recently shown to play an essential role in thrombosis, the formation of clots inside rather than outside a blood vessel, and also in stroke, in papers published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Medicine</i> in 2005 and 2006 by Dr. Thomas Renné and colleagues.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSaid Dr. Morrissey, “I met Dr. Renné over a lobster dinner in a chance meeting at a Gordon conference on hemostasis. We were excited by one another’s research and the connections between our work. His studies <i>in vivo</i> related strongly to our own experiments <i>in vitro.</i> We decided to work together to investigate more closely the relationships between the contact pathway, polyphosphates, and platelets.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis international collaboration has resulted in new findings appearing in the journal <i>Cell.</i> The paper shows, via a study involving several labs, that polyphosphate is also important in thrombotic diseases—abnormal processes in which unwanted blood clots block arteries or veins, causing often life-threatening tissue damage—and in platelet-driven inflammatory processes.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFor many decades, it has been known that the contact pathway of blood clotting can be triggered when blood is mixed with materials such as glass or clay, substances that blood would not normally come into contact with, even in disease states.  This is the underlying principle for a widely used diagnostic blood clotting test termed aPTT. The present study indicates that polyphosphate may represent the long-sought \"foreign\" substance that triggers blood clotting by activated platelets, certain types of tissue damage, and infectious organisms.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The data obtained in an international collaboration with British, Swedish, Dutch, German and American universities indicate that polyphosphate initiates blood clotting on platelets with critical importance for thrombotic diseases,” said Dr. Renné from the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe new study, suggesting that polyphosphate may represent a new target for interrupting thrombotic and inflammatory processes in multiple diseases, has myriad implications for new medical treatments of major diseases.<br /><br />\r\n','',1,'2009-12-10 15:15:00','MCB	Biochem','News','gillespi','2009-12-10 17:16:39','2009-12-17 16:14:51','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(154,'Steven Blanke finds link between stomach-cancer bug and cancer-promoting factor','Microbiology professor Steven Blanke has found that a factor produced by the bacterium <i>H. pylori</i> directly activates an enzyme in host cells that has been associated with several types of cancer, including gastric cancer.','Microbiology professor Steven Blanke has found that a factor produced by the bacterium <i>H. pylori</i> directly activates an enzyme in host cells that has been associated with several types of cancer, including gastric cancer.','',1,'2010-01-06 20:32:00','MCB	Micro','News','gillespi','2010-01-06 20:51:22','2010-01-06 20:51:22','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(155,'Sligar Published in <i>Journal of Cell Biology</i>','Professor of Biochemistry Stephen Sligar and colleagues have successfully recreated integrin activation <i>in vitro</i>, resolving long-standing uncertainties about the cellular mechanisms behind the process.','Professor of Biochemistry Stephen Sligar and colleagues have successfully recreated integrin activation <i>in vitro</i>, resolving long-standing uncertainties about the cellular mechanisms behind the process.

Nine graduate students were selected to receive the award, consisting of a $24,000 stipend.</p>\r\n<p>“The study of cancer, and looking for different mechanisms and targets for treating cancer, is fascinating,” Peterson says. </p>\r\n<p>Peterson is focusing on a compound, PAC-1, that re-activates cell-killing properties of a protein, procaspase-3. Researchers know that the procaspase-3 protein is important in apoptosis. For some reason, even though procaspase-3 is up-regulated in many cancers, it does not kill cells in that setting. </p>\r\n<p>A few years ago Hergenrother’s lab screened many compounds and found one, PAC-1, that increases the activity of procaspase-3. In mouse models, Hergenrother’s lab established that PAC-1 retarded the growth of the tumor by re-activating the moribund procaspase-3 protein. And, because procaspase-3 was up-regulated in cancer cells, those cells are more sensitive to the PAC-1 effects than healthy cells.</p>\r\n<p>“So this looked like a good compound to pursue through drug discovery,” says Peterson.</p>\r\n<p>Peterson, who arrived on campus in 2006, was part of the team that determined how PAC-1 works. He helped establish that zinc was inhibiting procaspase-3 from working and that PAC-1 was a zinc chelator. By chelating zinc, PAC-1 stops zinc from blocking the activity of procaspase-3 and thus enables procaspase-3 to kill cancer cells.</p>\r\n<p>But what of the dogs? Because Peterson is particularly interested in developing a new chemotherapy drug, he wanted to test the safety and efficacy of PAC-1 on dogs with lymphoma. In addition to understanding how PAC-1 works, he’d like to determine PAC-1’s toxicity and how it is metabolized, which will determine the best dosing procedure and the overall therapeutic strategy. </p>\r\n<p>And so the dog clinical trial was begun at the School of Veterinary Medicine in collaboration with Tim Fan at the Vet School and other graduate students in the Hergenrother lab. Local owners of dogs suffering from cancer were given an opportunity to volunteer their dogs for treatment, in exchange for not only the new procedure but conventional chemotherapy.</p>\r\n<p>In an early stage, using healthy, adult hound dogs to study how fast PAC-1 was metabolized, the researchers realized that the compound was getting into the central nervous system, where it was causing seizures. Peterson was able to re-design the compound so it could no longer permeate the central nervous system.</p>\r\n<p>“It’s incredibly safe,” he says of the re-designed compound, “it has very few side effects in dogs, which is not always the case in terms of conventional therapies.”</p>\r\n<p>The clinical trial is in a very early stage — only six dogs have been enrolled — but Peterson is cautiously optimistic about the preliminary findings. </p>\r\n<p>“We’ve been able to see a significance decrease in the growth of the cancer,” Peterson says. “Dogs with untreated lymphoma would survive only between four and six weeks. But after the four-week PAC-1 treatment, while there is not remission, there is no further tumor growth.</p>\r\n<p>“Ultimately we’re really hoping to find a PAC-1 derivative that is more stable and could be administered as a shot and have a longer lasting effect,” Peterson adds.</p>\r\n<p>By seeking dogs through other veterinary schools, Peterson hopes eventually to have 40 dogs in the trial and to get enough data to warrant human trials. </p>\r\n<p>“It would be very satisfying to anyone to see a strategy they helped develop to cure cancer was being used,” says Peterson.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100507quinnpeterson/weasel.jpg\" alt=\"Quinn Peterson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" />','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100507quinnpeterson/weasel300.jpg',1,'2010-05-13 10:49:00','MCB	Biochem','Feature','gillespi','2010-05-07 18:54:37','2010-05-13 16:23:36','William Gillespie',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(166,'Fragile X Syndrome','In this article, Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Stephanie Ceman discusses her research on Fragile X Syndrome.','<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited cognitive impairment, affecting 1 in 4000 males and 1 in 8000 females. FXS children often display language and motor delays as early as 9-12 months of age. In addition, 50-90% of FXS children have some symptoms and associated features of autism, including speech perseveration and other language abnormalities, gaze aversion and hand-flapping. </p><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100515ceman/child.jpg\" alt=\"Child.\" />\r\n<p> Individuals with FXS have mild physical abnormalities, including a larger head circumference, elongated face, large ears, and features of a mild connective tissue disorder.  Fragile X syndrome is caused by the loss of expression of one gene: the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 gene (FMR1), which is encoded on the X chromosome.  We are interested in how the protein encoded by this gene, FMRP, is required for normal cognition.  FMRP is expressed throughout the body; however, it is highly expressed in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.  In fact, when FMRP is absent, the part of neurons that receives input from other neurons is more immature-looking, suggesting that FMRP plays a critical role in normal neuronal function. </p>\r\n<p> FMRP binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs). mRNAs are copies of genes that encode proteins.  FMRP binds a collection of mRNAs and regulates their translation into proteins - a feature that is critical for normal neuronal function at the synapse where two neurons meet.  We are specifically interested in how FMRP is regulated. The structural features of FMRP are shown in Figure 1. The RGG box binds RNA with the highest affinity.  FMRP is estimated to associate with approximately 4% of brain mRNAs, and a large number of them have been identified.  A central question remains:  How does FMRP locate and bind its mRNAs and then regulate their translation? </p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100515ceman/fig1.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\" /></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"small\">Fig. 1. Schematic of FMRP showing the protein domains and phosphorylation sites. NLS-nuclear localization sequence, KH-homology to hnRNP K, NES-nuclear export sequence, RGG-arginine glycine rich region.  The three phosphorylated serines are indicated between the NES and RGG box at amino acids 496, 499, and 503.</p>\r\n<p>The first question we were interested in addressing was where in the cell does FMRP binds its mRNA cargoes? Cells are divided into nuclei, where all of the genomic DNA is located, and cytoplasm, where protein translation occurs. Our hypothesis was that FMRP binds its mRNA cargoes in the nucleus.  We tested this using genetically engineered FMRP constructs and direct visualization of FMRP association with newly synthesized mRNAs in Xenopus laevis ooctyes in collaboration with Dr. Michel Bellini.  These independent strategies allowed us to demonstrate that FMRP binds its mRNA cargoes in the nucleus, where the story of its regulatory functions begins.</p>\r\n<p> We have demonstrated that the RGG box of FMRP, which is the high affinity RNA binding domain, is methylated on four of its arginines.  Methylation can alter protein function by causing steric hindrance or by removing a hydrogen that participates in a hydrogen bond.   We have shown that the arginines that are methylated in FMRP are important for association with mRNAs, and we are actively studying how methylation of individual arginines affects RNA binding.</p>\r\n<p> Once FMRP binds its mRNAs, it regulates their translation: how it does this is also an active area of investigation in my lab.  FMRP associates with the microRNA pathway. microRNAs are small RNAs that regulate the stability or translational state of the mRNAs bearing microRNA binding sites. It is now estimated that expression of nearly half of our genes is regulated by microRNAs.  We have shown that FMRP is phosphorylated on three of its serines upstream of the RGG box (Fig.1). Phosphorylated FMRP associates with an increased amount of precursor microRNAs, which are unprocessed, thus, inactive microRNAs. We are currently testing the hypothesis that phosphorylated FMRP binds precursor microRNAs, sequesting them from being processed to their active state, while transporting mRNAs out to the synapse where translation is regulated (Fig.2). </p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100515ceman/fig2.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\" /></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"small\">Fig. 2. Newly synthesized FMRP is methylated before it enters the nucleus by PRMT3 and again by PRMT1 in the nucleus to modulate RNA binding by the RGG box. FMRP binds nascent transcripts and is exported from the nucleus. In the cytoplasm, phosphorylated FMRP  associates with pre-miRNAs and upon dephosphorylation associates with Dicer, which processes the pre-miRNAs into mature miRNAs that bind mRNAs. In this model the miRNA that binds the FMRP-associated mRNA also recruits FXR1p to activate translation. FXR1p is recruited by either FMRP or the miRNA-mRNA complex and regulates translation of some mRNAs under specific conditions. </p>\r\n<p> This work is currently sponsored by the Spastic Paralysis Research Foundation of the Illinois-Eastern Iowa District of Kiwanis International.</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20100515ceman/ceman300.jpg',1,'2010-05-13 10:59:00','MCB	CDB','Feature','gillespi','2010-05-10 21:15:23','2010-05-13 16:49:49','Stephanie Ceman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(174,'Emad Tajkhorshid recognized as exceptional by Campus Committee on Promotion and Tenure','Of the approximately 100 cases that the Campus Committee on Promotion and Tenure reviewed this year, Associate Professor of Biochemistry Emad Tajkhorshid\'s dossier was one of just four recognized as exceptional in terms of quality of work and overall achievement.','Of the approximately 100 cases that the Campus Committee on Promotion and Tenure reviewed this year, Associate Professor of Biochemistry Emad Tajkhorshid\'s dossier was one of just four recognized as exceptional in terms of quality of work and overall achievement.\r\n\r\nThere are two of these awards given to those who have just received tenure and were promoted to the rank of associate professor.

In addition, he is a collaborator in a multi-disciplinary team that has received a grant from the DOE....  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"With an unwavering commitment, Colin has dedicated himself to enhancing every aspect of the teaching mission of the university. At the undergraduate level, he has endeavored to raise the quality of the Biochemistry degree to an \'elite\' status, in part by instituting a research requirement among other threshold benchmarks. To reach out to new students, he initiated workshops for undergraduates in Biochemistry and, as a result of that, established a new course, Bioch 190 for incoming Freshman....\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"As Department Head since 2004, Colin has steadily increased shouldering much of the burdens of the Biochemistry Department, most times nearly single-handed. One clear example is the Phase I renovation project of RAL [Roger Adams Lab] and its future plans, which are a legacy that should be attributed to Colin\'s relentless efforts.

Not only does he provide the necessary biochemical analyses, he also tests his hypotheses using genetics because a given hypothesis predicts a given outcome for certain mutant bacteria.  In addition, he employs genetics to construct mutant bacterial strains in which he can test physiological outcomes based on his hypotheses.  These approaches reflect a true interest in the biology of these processes and a willingness to challenge the biochemistry with physiology and vice versa.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"For the first part of his U of I career Professor Imlay taught our microbial physiology course to advanced undergraduates and graduate students and did an excellent job.  Upon the reorganization of the LAS School of Life Sciences into two schools, the new School of Molecular and Cell Biology instituted two new courses that all incoming graduate student would take regardless of departmental affiliation.  Imlay not only played a major role in implementing these courses, he has taught one of the courses since its inception.  This is a very well regarded course, both by the students and the faculty.  He is also an outstanding mentor of graduate students and undergraduate research students.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"In my opinion James Imlay was the most important person in getting the graduate program of the School of Molecular and Cell Biology up and running.  Furthermore, without his organization of the graduate program the School would not be the well-functioning entity it is today.\"  \r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"...James Imlay is the ideal faculty member.

They have shown that in human cells, this protein binds to heterochromatic structures, and plays an essential role in DNA replication. ','Accurate duplication of genetic material and the faithful segregation of chromosomes are critical for cell survival.  The initiation of DNA replication is linked both to cell cycle progression and chromatin organization.  In plants, animals and other “eukaryotes,” the assembly of a multi-protein complex called pre-replicative complex (preRC) is the first step in the initiation of DNA replication.  As the name implies, origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins bind to origins of DNA replication. Subsequently, other components of preRC are assembled at these sites.  In addition to its role in DNA replication, ORC is also involved in gene silencing and organization of the tightly packed DNA, called heterochromatin. How ORC is brought to the DNA in human cells had previously remained a mystery.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nResearchers at the University of Illinois, led by Professor Supriya Prasanth from the department of cell and developmental biology, have identified a novel protein that is highly conserved in higher eukaryotes. They have shown that in human cells, this protein (once known as LRWD1 but renamed  ORCA, for “ORC-associated” protein) associates with ORC and shows similar cell cycle dynamics to ORC.  Along with ORC, this protein binds to heterochromatic structures, including centromeres and telomeres, which are important to cell division and chromosome maintenance.  \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers further demonstrated that ORCA efficiently recruits ORC to chromatin, the DNA and proteins that make up the chromosome.  Depletion of ORCA in human primary cells as well as in embryonic stem cells results in the loss of ORC binding to chromatin and subsequent arrest of cells in a vital phase of the cell cycle.  Loss of ORCA results in defects in cellular proliferation, suggesting that a fine-tuned balance in the levels of ORCA is maintained in a normal cell.  These results suggest that a novel protein, ORCA, is critical for initiation of DNA replication and heterochromatin organization in mammalian cells.   \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis work appears in the October 8, 2010 issue of the journal <em>Molecular Cell.</em>\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The discovery of this new protein is going to be revolutionary in the field of replication and cell cycle,” Prasanth said.  “We all know that diseases like cancer are caused by uncontrolled proliferation of cells, and our data demonstrates that ORCA controls proliferation of cells.  This work is going to have important implications in cancer biology.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe study was spearheaded by Zhen Shen, a graduate student, with assistance from post-doctoral fellows Kizhakke M. Sathyan and Arindam Chakraborty.

The antiproliferative action of progesterone in the uterus is of high clinical significance since breakdown of this action underpins female infertility as well as estrogen-driven hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.\r\n','<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20110222bagchi/bagchi_lab.jpg\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Bagchi team in the lab.\">\r\n\r\n<p>University researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health have identified a key step in the establishment of a pregnancy:  how the hormone progesterone suppresses the growth of the uterus’s lining so that a fertilized egg can implant in the uterus.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis key step, the researchers discovered, occurs when a protein called Hand2 suppresses the chemical activity that stimulates growth of the uterine lining, also known as uterine epithelium.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nAt the start of each menstrual cycle, levels of the hormone estrogen begin to rise.  Estrogen stimulates the cells in the uterine lining to increase in number, causing the epithelium to thicken.  However, as the ovary releases an egg, levels of the hormone progesterone begin to rise. The elevated progesterone levels put the brakes on this estrogen-driven growth of the uterine epithelium.  In this study, the researchers discovered that Hand2, previously found to increase in uterine cells with rising progesterone levels, is the switch that turns off estrogen’s stimulating effect on the epithelium. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nThe finding may contribute to an understanding of at least some forms of unexplained female infertility.  The finding also has implications for understanding disorders in which uterine growth surges out of control, such as in <a href=\"\"http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/endometrial>endometrial cancer</a> or <a href=\"http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/endometriosis.cfm\">endometriosis</a>, a disease in which endometrial tissue attaches to inappropriate sites and grows outside the uterus.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n“Progesterone-like medications are used to treat a wide variety of conditions, such as relieving the symptoms of menopause, as part of infertility treatments, and for preventing preterm birth,” said Louis DePaolo, Ph.D., head of the Reproductive Sciences Branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the NIH institute that funded the study.  “Understanding how Hand2 exerts its effect on uterine growth may lead to the development of new medications and therapeutics that make progesterone treatment more effective and  with fewer side effects, as well as provide important insights to the etiology of progesterone-resistant diseases such as endometriosis.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\nFirst author Research Scientist Quanxi Li of the Department of Comparative Biosciences was joined on the research team by corresponding authors Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Milan K.

Through a series of experiments, the researchers determined that estrogen stimulates the production of growth factors, which cause cells in the epithelial layer to multiply and grow. When progesterone is produced, it spurs the expression of Hand2, which stops the production of growth factors. The uterine epithelial cells stop multiplying, and then mature so that they can attach to the embryo to begin the implantation process.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This information helps us understand how an interplay of hormones prepares the uterus to host and support the embryo as it grows,” said Dr. Milan Bagchi.  “Our next priority will be to examine whether Hand2 plays a critical role in the human uterus as well.” \r\n</p><p align=\"center\">\r\n<strong>Adapted from a NIH press release.</strong>\r\n</P>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20110222bagchi/bagchi_lab300.jpg',1,'2011-02-21 08:58:00','MCB	Physiology','Feature','gillespi','2011-02-21 20:09:07','2011-02-23 16:08:01','National Institutes of Health',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(202,'Posttranslational Methylation by PRMT5 Increases SHP Repression Activity upon Bile Acid Signaling','The journal <i>Molecular and Cellular Biology</i> is featuring \"Arginine methylation by PRMT5 at a naturally-occurring mutation site is critical for liver metabolic regulation by Small Heterodimer Partner\" by corresponding author Associate Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Jongsook Kim Kemper and colleagues.','The journal <i>Molecular and Cellular Biology</i> has published \"Arginine methylation by PRMT5 at a naturally-occurring mutation site is critical for liver metabolic regulation by Small Heterodimer Partner\" by corresponding author Associate Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Jongsook Kim Kemper and colleagues.\r\n<br /<br />\r\nAbout the findings, Kemper reports: \r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"Small Heterodimer Partner (SHP) is critical in maintaining cholesterol and bile acid levels.

Brian Stauffer</p>\r\n<p>Blood clotting is a complicated business, particularly for those trying to understand how the body responds to injury. In a new study, researchers report that they are the first to describe in atomic detail a chemical interaction that is vital to blood clotting. This interaction – between a clotting factor and a cell membrane – has baffled scientists for decades.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe study appears online in the <em>Journal of Biological Chemistry</em>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“For decades, people have known that blood-clotting proteins have to bind to a cell membrane in order for the clotting reaction to happen,” said University of Illinois biochemistry professor James Morrissey, who led the study with chemistry professor Chad Rienstra and biochemistry, biophysics and pharmacology professor Emad Tajkhorshid. “If you take clotting factors off the membrane, they’re thousands of times less active.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers combined laboratory detective work with supercomputer simulations and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) to get at the problem from every angle. They also made use of tiny rafts of lipid membranes called nanodiscs, using an approach developed at Illinois by biochemistry professor Stephen Sligar.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nPrevious studies had shown that each clotting factor contains a region, called the GLA domain, which interacts with specific lipids in cell membranes to start the cascade of chemical reactions that drive blood clotting.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOne study, published in 2003 in the journal <em>Nature Structural Biology</em>, indicated that the GLA domain binds to a special phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS), which is embedded in the membrane. Other studies had shown that PS binds weakly to the clotting factor on its own, but in the presence of another phospholipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the interaction is much stronger.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nBoth PS and PE are abundant in the inner – but not the outer – leaflets of the double-layered membranes of cells. This keeps these lipids from coming into contact with clotting factors in the blood. But any injury that ruptures the cells brings PS and PE together with the clotting factors, initiating a chain of events that leads to blood clotting.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nResearchers have developed many hypotheses to explain why clotting factors bind most readily to PS when PE is present. But none of these could fully explain the data.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the new study, Morrissey’s lab engineered nanodiscs with high concentrations of PS and PE, and conducted functional tests to determine if they responded like normal membranes.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“We found that the nanodisc actually is very representative of what really happens in the cell in terms of the reaction of the lipids and the role that they play,” Morrissey said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThen Tajkhorshid’s lab used advanced modeling and simulation methods to position every atom in the system and simulated the molecular interactions on a supercomputer. The simulations indicated that one PS molecule was linking directly to the GLA domain of the clotting factor via an amino acid (serine) on its head-group (the non-oily region of a phospholipid that orients toward the membrane surface).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMore surprisingly, the simulations indicated that six other phospholipids also were drawing close to the GLA domain. These lipids, however, were bending their head-groups out of the way so that their phosphates, which are negatively charged, could interact with positively charged calcium ions associated with the GLA domain. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-Hck-ldzDo\">Watch a movie of the simulation.</a>)\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The simulations were a breakthrough for us,” Morrissey said. “They provided a detailed view of how things might come together during membrane binding of coagulation factors. But these predictions had to be tested experimentally.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nRienstra’s lab then analyzed the samples using SSNMR, a technique that allows researchers to precisely measure the distances and angles between individual atoms in large molecules or groups of interacting molecules. His group found that one of every six or seven PS molecules was binding directly to the clotting factor, providing strong experimental support for the model derived from the simulations.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“That turned out to be a key insight that we contributed to this study,” Rienstra said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe team reasoned that if the PE head-groups were simply bending out of the way, then any phospholipid with a sufficiently small head-group should work as well as PE in the presence of PS. This also explained why only one PS molecule was actually binding to a GLA domain. The other phospholipids nearby were also interacting with the clotting factor, but more weakly.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe finding explained another mystery that had long daunted researchers. A different type of membrane lipid, phosphatidylcholine (PC), which has a very large head-group and is most abundant on the outer surface of cells, was known to block any association between the membrane and the clotting factor, even in the presence of PS.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nFollow-up experiments showed that any phospholipid but PC enhanced the binding of PS to the GLA domain. This led to the “ABC” hypothesis: when PS is present, the GLA domain will interact with “Anything But Choline.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This is the first real insight at an atomic level of how most of the blood-clotting proteins interact with membranes, an interaction that’s known to be essential to blood clotting,” Morrissey said. The findings offer new targets for the development of drugs to regulate blood clotting, he said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMorrissey and Tajkhorshid have their primary appointments in the U. of I.

Brian Stauffer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Researchers have identified a protein long known to regulate gene expression as a potent suppressor of breast cancer growth. Their study, in the journal <em>Oncogene</em>, is the first to demonstrate how this protein, known as Runx3, accomplishes this feat.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n “People suggested that Runx3 might be a tumor suppressor in breast cancer because they found that it is down-regulated in a lot of breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer tissues,” said University of Illinois medical biochemistry professor Lin-Feng Chen, who led the study. But no previous studies uncovered direct evidence to support that idea, he said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn the new study, Chen and his colleagues at Nagasaki University discovered that a significant proportion of mice lacking one of two Runx3 genes spontaneously developed mammary gland tumors at 14 or 15 months of life – an age corresponding to age 40 to 50 in humans.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“We found mammary tumors growing in about 20 percent of the female mice lacking a copy of the Runx3 gene,” Chen said. None of the mice with two normal copies of the gene developed tumors.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers also found that estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha), a well-known culprit in the development of many breast tumors, was up-regulated in the mouse tumors. ER-alpha is overexpressed in about 75 percent of human cases of breast cancer, and enhanced ER-alpha expression in normal breast tissue is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, Chen said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nCirculating estrogen binds to ER-alpha and initiates a chain of events that alter gene expression in the targeted cell. This is a normal part of cellular signaling, but in ER-positive breast cancers, the overexpression of ER-alpha leads to enhanced tumor cell survival, growth and proliferation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers found that when Runx3 was re-introduced into ER-alpha positive breast cancer cell lines, it suppressed the growth of the cancer cells and inhibited the potential of the cancer cells to form tumors in the mouse. Further experiments revealed that Runx3 actually targeted ER-alpha signaling by inducing the degradation of ER-alpha.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“By regulating the cellular levels of ER-alpha, Runx3 appears to control the cell’s response to circulating estrogen, thus playing an important role in the onset of breast cancer,” Chen said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nChen sees three potential benefits that spring from this study. First, the researchers have discovered a mouse model of spontaneously occurring mammary tumors that corresponds to an age of increased risk of breast cancer in humans.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSecond, Chen hopes to develop a simple test to measure Runx3 levels in mammary tissue.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“We know from other people’s studies that Runx3 is inactivated in the early stages of breast cancer,” he said. “So we might be able to use Runx3 as a biomarker of early stage breast cancer.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAnd third, since the Runx3 gene appears to be intact but inactivated in breast cancer, future studies will focus on reversing its inactivation, Chen said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“If you can reactivate Runx3, then you can suppress tumor growth,” he said.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe study team also included researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and the National University of Singapore.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe National Institutes of Health and the U. of I.

Brian Stauffer</p>\r\n<p>In a new study, researchers discovered that levels of microRNAs – short lengths of ribonucleic acid that appear to regulate protein production – go up or down in the songbird brain after it hears a new song. These microRNAs likely represent a new class of regulatory agents that fine-tune the brain’s response to social information, said Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology David Clayton, who led the study.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nMicroRNAs are part of a new frontier in genomic biology: the 90 percent of human DNA that doesn’t code for proteins. This “dark matter of the genome” includes genes that are transcribed into many different types of RNA molecules. Scientists are still working to decipher their various structures and functions.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nPrevious studies found that brain microRNAs “undergo dramatic changes in expression during development and aging and have been functionally implicated in neurological disease,” the authors wrote in their paper in <em>BMC Genomics</em>. MicroRNAs appear to regulate the expression of protein-coding genes by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts, the blueprints for proteins, before they can be translated into proteins.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nClayton and other researchers have documented changes in the expression of many mRNAs in the songbird brain after it hears an unfamiliar song. But no studies have, until now, found evidence that microRNAs also contribute to the process by which the brain responds to its environment.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n “The question that we started with was, are there microRNAs that are showing a response to song in the brain?” Clayton said. “And the answer is clearly yes, there are. The bigger question that we don’t have an answer to yet is what are they doing?”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe study team, which included researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine and the University of Houston, also identified a microRNA that went up in males and down in females after the birds heard a new song. The gene for this microRNA is on the Z chromosome, the zebra finch’s sex chromosome. Male zebra finches have two copies of the gene and females have only one, suggesting that even baseline levels of this microRNA differ between the sexes.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“To my knowledge, this is the first example of a gene response that’s different in male and female songbirds,” said Clayton, who is an affiliate of the Institute of Genomic Biology and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, both at Illinois.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nSince microRNAs can interfere with the translation of mRNAs into protein, Clayton hypothesizes that mRNAs play a part in fine-tuning the brain’s response to important signals.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“We do see a sudden disappearance of some types of messenger RNA shortly after a bird hears a song,” he said. “We don’t yet know the mechanism of that, but that’s something a microRNA could be doing.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.life.illinois.edu/clayton/Movies/Roy%27s_Finches_for_streaming.mov\">(See movie)</a></p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20110701clayton/clayton300.jpg',0,'2011-07-01 04:01:00','MCB	CDB','Feature','gillespi','2011-07-01 15:11:35','2012-08-30 14:42:12','Diana Yates',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(247,'Yejing Ge receives the Procter & Gamble Award','Yejing Ge, a graduate student in Jie Chen Lab, is the recipient of the\r\n2012 Procter & Gamble Graduate Student Research Award.','Yejing Ge, a graduate student in Jie Chen Lab, is the recipient of the\r\n2012 Procter & Gamble Graduate Student Research Award.

Brian Stauffer</p>\r\n<p>\r\nUsing a high-resolution single-molecule study technique, MCB researchers have seen the very subtle differences between two branches of an important family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAssociate Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Claudio Grosman and research scientist Gisela Cymes published their work in the journal <em>Nature</em>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNicotinic-type receptors are proteins embedded in the membranes of nerve and muscle cells that regulate activity. A neurotransmitter, such as acetylcholine, triggers a small conformation change in the protein that opens a channel and allows ions to flow into the cell. These receptors are key players in muscle motion and neurological diseases such as epilepsy.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe protein family is divided into two classes, with very similar structure but different functions: One mediates inhibition by channeling anions, or negatively charged ions, while the other mediates excitation by channeling positively charged cations.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This is the yin and yang of the central nervous system,” said Grosman, a professor of molecular and integrative physiology, of biophysics and of neuroscience. “The anion members of the family and the cation members of the family pretty much look the same. The overall structure is the same. So, the question is, what is the reason for the different charge selectivity?” \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe team focused on the segment of protein lining the inside of the channel. The two types of channels display very small differences in their sequence of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Both the anion-selective and cation-selective channels have a ring of basic amino acids, lysine or arginine, which generally carry a positive charge. This makes sense for an anion-selective channel, but raises some questions about why cations are not repelled by these positive charges.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe charge of amino acid residues is a fundamental aspect of protein function and structure.  In order to model proteins computationally, researchers have to assign a charge to each residue, so they rely on the charge the amino acid would display in bulk water – for example, assuming that basic residues are always positively charged. However, proteins offer a much more complex environment, and it can be difficult for researchers to determine whether a particular amino acid has accepted or lost a proton to become charged.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nGrosman and Cymes use an approach called patch-clamp recording, a single-molecule technique that allows them to measure binding and unbinding of single protons in functioning molecules, something that other powerful approaches cannot achieve.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith patch-clamp recording, the researchers could see the charge state of working ion channels in living cells. They saw that, in anion-selective channels, the basic residues appear to have the expected positive charge. However, in the cation-selective channels, the lysine or arginine seems to be tucked into the protein structure so that it cannot accept a proton from the surrounding environment and instead remains neutral. This allows cation-selective channels to keep the basic residues in their sequential place without having to substitute them with other amino acids.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“These channels are the subject of a lot of computational studies. Before this paper, if researchers had to model these channels, they would always run the simulation with all the ionizable residues charged, and the simulation could well be wrong,” Grosman said. “With small tweaks, changing the position of the amino acid changes its properties. For a lysine to be protonated or deprotonated is a big difference. It’s not trivial.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“Overall, we want to emphasize the notion that the properties of these chargeable amino acids depends strongly on their particular microenvironment in the whole protein,” Grosman added.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWhile the study focused on muscle acetylcholine receptors, Grosman believes the “tucked-in” principle holds true for the entire superfamily of nicotinic-type receptors.  Next, they plan to use the patch-clamp technique to further investigate the amino acids neighboring the lysine or arginine to gain a greater understanding of how this class of proteins regulates inhibition and excitation.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This approach has opened a window and we can start understanding things that were intractable until now,” said Grosman. “This is important because it brings us closer to what the protein actually looks like if we want to understand how it works.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health.</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20110628grosman/grosman300.jpg',1,'2011-06-28 15:28:00','MCB	Physiology','Feature','gillespi','2011-07-01 15:34:26','2011-07-01 16:19:15','Liz Ahlberg',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(218,'James Morrissey Awarded the Biennial Investigator Recognition Award for Contributions to Haemostasis','In recognition of his distinguished record as teacher and researcher, Professor of Biochemistry James Morrissey will be awarded the Biennial Investigator Recognition Award for Contributions to Haemostasis from the International Society on Thrombosis & Haemostasis (ISTH).','In recognition of his distinguished record as teacher and researcher, Professor of Biochemistry James Morrissey was awarded the Biennial Investigator Recognition Award for Contributions to Haemostasis from the International Society on Thrombosis & Haemostasis (ISTH).\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe award was presented during the biennial Congress of the Society, held this year in Kyoto, Japan.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAccording to ISTH, \"Initiated in 1982, the Biennial Awards for Contributions to Hemostasis recognize individuals who, in the opinion of their co-workers and peers, have made significant contributions to research and education in blood coagulation...\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe Nominating Committee for the Biennial Awards is comprised of the Society\'s Senior Advisory Council, 99 distinguished and internationally recognized experts who have previously served as elected members of the ISTH Scientific and Standardization Committee.

','<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20120104wang/wang_group.jpg\"><p>Clinical gene therapy may be one step closer, thanks to a new twist on an old class of molecules.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA group of University of Illinois researchers, led in part by Assistant Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Fei Wang, have demonstrated that short spiral-shaped proteins can efficiently deliver DNA segments to cells. The team published its work in the journal <em>Angewandte Chemie</em>.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The main idea is these are new materials that could potentially be used for clinical gene therapy,” said Jianjun Cheng, a professor of materials science and engineering, of chemistry and of bioengineering.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nResearchers have been exploring two main pathways for gene delivery: modified viruses and nonviral agents such as synthetic polymers or lipids. The challenge has been to address both toxicity and efficiency. Polypeptides, or short protein chains, are attractive materials because they are biocompatible, fine-tunable and small.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“There are very good in vitrotransfection agents available, but we cannot use them in vivo because of their toxicity or because some of the complexes are too large,” Cheng said. “Using our polypeptides, we can control the size down to the 200 nanometer range, which makes it a very interesting delivery system for in vivo applications.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nA polypeptide called poly-L-lysine (PLL) was an early contender in gene delivery studies. PLL has positively charged side chains – molecular structures that stem from each amino acid link in the polypeptide chain – so it is soluble in the watery cellular environment.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nHowever, PLL gradually fell into disuse because of its limited ability to deliver genes to the inside of cells, a process called transfection, and its high toxicity. Cheng postulated that PLL’s low efficiency could be a function of its globular shape, as polypeptides with charged side chains tend to adopt a random coil structure, instead of a more orderly spiral helix.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“We never studied the connections of conformation with transfection efficiency, because we were never able to synthetically make materials containing both cationic charge and a high percentage of helical structures,” Cheng said. “This paper demonstrated for the first time that helicity has a huge impact on transfection efficiencies.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nEarlier this year, Cheng’s group developed a method of making helical polypeptides with positively charged side chains. To test whether a helical polypeptide could be an efficient gene delivery agent, the group assembled a library of 31 helical polypeptides that are stable over a broad pH range and can bond to DNA for delivery. Most of them outperformed PLL and a few outstripped a leading commercial agent called polyethyleneimine (PEI), notorious for its toxicity although it is highly efficient. The helical molecules even worked on some of the hardest cells to transfect: stem cells and fibroblast cells.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“People kind of gave up on polypeptide-based materials for gene deliveries because PLL had low efficiency and high toxicity,” Cheng said. “The polypeptide that we designed, synthesized and used in this study has very high efficiency and also well-controlled toxicities. With a modified helical polypeptide, we demonstrated that we can outperform many commercial agents.”\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe polypeptides Cheng and his co-workers developed can adopt helical shapes because the side chains are longer, so that the positive charges do not interfere with the protein’s winding. The positive charges readily bind to negatively charged DNA, forming complexes that are internalized into cellular compartments called endosomes. The helical structures rupture the endosomal membranes, letting the DNA escape into the cell.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTo confirm that the spiral polypeptide shape is the key to transfection, the researchers then synthesized two batches of the most efficient polypeptide: one batch with a helical shape, one with the usual random coil. The helical polypeptide far exceeded the random-coil polypeptide in both efficiency and stability.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This demonstrates that the helicity is very important, because the polymer has exactly the same chemical makeup; the only difference is the structure,” said Cheng, who also is associated with the Institute for Genomic Biology and the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, both at the U. of I.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nNext, the researchers plan to further explore their helical polypeptides’ properties, especially their cell-penetrating abilities. They hope to control sequence and structure with precision for specific applications, including gene delivery, drug delivery, cell-membrane penetration and antimicrobial action.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health supported this work.

Whereas our knowledge of growth factor signaling is quite extensive, the mechanisms of nutrient-sensing are less well-understood. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of cell growth by assembling a protein complex – mTORC1 – that senses the availability of amino acids. In this study led by Research Scientist Dr. Mee-Sup Yoon in the Chen laboratory, a novel pathway connecting amino acid signals to mTORC1 activation has been identified. These researchers have found that in response to amino acid stimulation the class III PI-3-kinase hVps34, through its enzymatic product PI3P, activates the phospholipase PLD1, which in turn produces phosphatidic acid that directly activates the mTORC1 kinase. Interestingly, their data have also revealed that the amino acids–hVp34–PI3P pathway leads to translocation of PLD1 to the surface of lysosomes, where mTORC1 is localized via the Rag–Ragulator pathway. They have further demonstrated that the lysosomal translocation of PLD1 is necessary for the activation of mTORC1 and cell growth. Hence, two parallel pathways converge on the lysosome in response to nutrient signals to regulate cell growth. The physiological significance of the lysosome serving as a platform to assemble nutrient-sensing signaling remains an intriguing question for future investigations.','/departments/cdb/highlights/acid_sensing.png',0,'2012-01-01 00:58:00','CDB','News','gillespi','2012-04-27 00:59:42','2012-10-25 21:12:55','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(248,'Accelerating Membrane Insertion of Peripheral Proteins with a Novel Membrane Mimetic Model','Emad Tajkhorshid is corresponding author on \"Accelerating Membrane Insertion of Peripheral Proteins with a Novel Membrane Mimetic Model,\" selected as the feature cover article in the May 2 issue of <em>Biophysical Journal.</em>','Associate Professor of Biochemistry Emad Tajkhorshid is corresponding author on \"Accelerating Membrane Insertion of Peripheral Proteins with a Novel Membrane Mimetic Model,\" selected as the feature cover article in the May 2 issue of <em>Biophysical Journal.</em> Colin Wraight describes the new membrane model as \"quite a significant advance in computation for membrane systems.\"','',1,'2012-05-13 18:51:00','MCB	Biochem','News','gillespi','2012-05-31 18:58:29','2012-06-18 19:29:04','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(252,'James H.

','<p>\r\nThis tool provides an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms at work during this myeloid differentiation process, and may improve our ability to treat myeloid diseases like leukemia. \r\n</p><p>\r\nTheir findings appear in the journal <em>Blood</em>. \r\n</p><p>\r\nMyeloids are blood stem cells from bone marrow or the spinal cord that are turned into common types of white blood cells like neutrophils and macrophages through the process of myeloid differentiation. Deficiencies in this differentiation process cause leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells. \r\nResearchers in the field had previously studied myeloid differentiation using two types of cell systems. In one method of study, scientists performed experiments using primary cells, or those cells taken directly from animals. Scientists have also utilized leukemia tumor cells in this research by returning them to their previous myeloid stem cell-like states. However, primary cells are hard to grow and manipulate genetically, and tumor cells still contain the genetic mutations that caused these cells to divide uncontrollably in the first place. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe drawbacks of these systems prompted Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and corresponding author Fei Wang to develop a different system to better understand the mechanisms of myeloid differentiation. \r\nWang and his team began by turning mouse embryonic stem cells into myeloid progenitor cells. They then added a protein called Hoxb8 to these cells that had been shown previously to immortalize myeloid progenitor cells so that they do not die and grow indefinitely. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This really simplified the whole system, so, number one, we didn’t have to deal with animals or human bodies, and, number two, we immortalized these cells so that they can be easily handled in culture and maintain normal myeloid progenitor cell genetic information,” Wang said. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers wanted to prove that their model is effective in determining the molecular mechanisms important to myeloid differentiation. Enzymes called protein kinases are known to mediate processes like cell development, immune response, and cell differentiation. They screened a variety of protein kinase inhibitors to find potential key regulators of myeloid differentiation.\r\nA protein kinase inhibitor of a molecule called mTor, a master regulator of cell behavior, was found to interfere with myeloid differentiation, signifying that mTor is a key regulator of this process. A variety of experiments were performed both inside and outside the mouse body with mTor to further prove that this molecule is necessary for myeloid differentiation. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The function of this molecule had not been defined prior to this study in the context of myeloid differentiation,” Wang said, “This is the first evidence showing that this molecule plays a significant role in myeloid differentiation.”\r\nThis finding serves as a proof of principle that the new system provides a powerful tool for future studies of normal and abnormal myeloid differentiation.\r\n“Using this system, we can introduce genetic manipulations that tell us something very important about how normal myeloid differentiation works, and what kind of molecular events in this process can go wrong, leading to diseases like leukemia,” Wang said. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“People can use this as a platform for large-scale screening analysis for drugs that potentially can promote myeloid differentiation and can slow down or stop myeloid disease processes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20121023wang/wang515.jpg\" alt=\"Fei Wang.\">\r\n<p class=\"small\">Dr. Fei Wang and the co-corresponding author Dr. Dong Li.</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20121023wang/wang313.jpg',0,'2012-10-22 18:15:00','MCB','Highlight','gillespi','2012-10-23 18:23:29','2014-07-23 19:35:43','Chelsey Coombs','wang313.jpg','image/jpeg',19152,'2013-08-21 16:32:41',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',''),(270,'Using planarian flatworms to understand organ regeneration','In a new study published in the October 16 issue of <em>Developmental Cell</em>, corresponding author Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator Phillip Newmark and colleagues report the identification of genes that control growth and regeneration of the intestine in the freshwater planarian <em>Schmidtea mediterranea</em>.','<br />\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20121024newmark/planaria.jpg\">\r\n<p class=\"small\">\r\nFIGURE: The intestine of the planarian <em>Schmidtea mediterranea</em>, a model for stem cell-based organogenesis.

Their findings appear in the journal <em>Blood</em>. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nMyeloids are blood stem cells from bone marrow or the spinal cord that are turned into common types of white blood cells like neutrophils and macrophages through the process of myeloid differentiation. Deficiencies in this differentiation process cause leukemia, or cancer of the white blood cells. \r\nResearchers in the field had previously studied myeloid differentiation using two types of cell systems. In one method of study, scientists performed experiments using primary cells, or those cells taken directly from animals. Scientists have also utilized leukemia tumor cells in this research by returning them to their previous myeloid stem cell-like states. However, primary cells are hard to grow and manipulate genetically, and tumor cells still contain the genetic mutations that caused these cells to divide uncontrollably in the first place. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe drawbacks of these systems prompted Associate Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology and corresponding author Fei Wang to develop a different system to better understand the mechanisms of myeloid differentiation. \r\nWang and his team began by turning mouse embryonic stem cells into myeloid progenitor cells. They then added a protein called Hoxb8 to these cells that had been shown previously to immortalize myeloid progenitor cells so that they do not die and grow indefinitely. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“This really simplified the whole system, so, number one, we didn’t have to deal with animals or human bodies, and, number two, we immortalized these cells so that they can be easily handled in culture and maintain normal myeloid progenitor cell genetic information,” Wang said. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe researchers wanted to prove that their model is effective in determining the molecular mechanisms important to myeloid differentiation. Enzymes called protein kinases are known to mediate processes like cell development, immune response, and cell differentiation. They screened a variety of protein kinase inhibitors to find potential key regulators of myeloid differentiation.\r\nA protein kinase inhibitor of a molecule called mTor, a master regulator of cell behavior, was found to interfere with myeloid differentiation, signifying that mTor is a key regulator of this process. A variety of experiments were performed both inside and outside the mouse body with mTor to further prove that this molecule is necessary for myeloid differentiation. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“The function of this molecule had not been defined prior to this study in the context of myeloid differentiation,” Wang said, “This is the first evidence showing that this molecule plays a significant role in myeloid differentiation.”\r\nThis finding serves as a proof of principle that the new system provides a powerful tool for future studies of normal and abnormal myeloid differentiation.\r\n“Using this system, we can introduce genetic manipulations that tell us something very important about how normal myeloid differentiation works, and what kind of molecular events in this process can go wrong, leading to diseases like leukemia,” Wang said. \r\n<br /><br />\r\n“People can use this as a platform for large-scale screening analysis for drugs that potentially can promote myeloid differentiation and can slow down or stop myeloid disease processes.”\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20121023wang/wang515.jpg\" alt=\"Fei Wang.\">\r\n<p class=\"small\">Dr. Fei Wang and the co-corresponding author Dr. Dong Li.</p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/departments/cdb/highlights/20121025wang.png',0,'2012-10-25 02:06:00','CDB','Highlight','gillespi','2012-10-25 19:13:03','2014-07-23 19:32:21','Chelsey Coombs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'20121025wang.png','image/png',114460,'2013-08-21 16:57:59','',''),(290,'Assistant Professor Auinash Kalsotra Awarded Two-Year Roy J.

','Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Ann M. Nardulli and colleagues at the University of Illinois and the Mayo Clinic have created a new technique for identifying methylated DNA, a modification to our genetic material that has been shown to correlate with the disease severity and metastasis ability of various types of cancers.  <br><br>\r\n	Genetics has been a hot topic among biologists since Watson and Crick first discovered the structure of DNA, the molecule that encodes the information in all living things. As important as the DNA itself is, scientists are now finding that the study of epigenetics, a word that literally means “on top of genetics” and refers to additional chemical modifications to DNA, may give us clues to the causes of human diseases.<br><br>\r\n	Methylation, the addition of a –CH3 group to a molecule, is one of the most highly characterized epigenetic modifications. The addition of this little group has been shown to cause changes in gene expression, and often contributes to the induction and development of certain diseases like cancer.<br><br>\r\n	While the analysis of these methylation patterns may point to novel ways to diagnose and treat these diseases, the current techniques for these analyses are labor intensive and require large sample volumes of DNA for accuracy. <br><br>\r\n	The researchers have now developed a single-molecule test for DNA methylation using a synthetic membrane with a hole in it, known as a nanopore, which lets only one molecule pass through it to be identified. DNA is negatively charged and is able to pass through a nanopore due to charge differences on either side of the membrane. The side of the membrane that the DNA begins on is negatively charged, which repels the similarly-charged DNA, while the side that the DNA is supposed to go to is positively charged, which attracts the DNA through the nanopore. This movement creates a characteristic electrical current reading.<br><br>\r\n	The scientists were able to label methylated DNA bases with a protein called MBD1 which binds to these modified bases, while leaving unmethylated DNA bases unlabeled. Because DNA bound to the MBD1 protein has a larger diameter than the nanopore’s diameter, it will not migrate through the pore, creating a different electrical current reading than that shown when the non-methylated, unlabeled DNA passes through the nanopore. This allows scientists to differentiate non-methylated and methylated DNA simply by measuring the electrical current. <br><br>\r\n	While more research and development of this test is necessary to refine the process, the future clinical applications for this technology will be invaluable. Scientists may soon be able to quantify and map the locations of the MBD-1 proteins bound to target DNA molecules, providing more information and a detection method for diseases that have a characteristic methylation pattern.

In passive transport, molecules are able to pass through a membrane protein called a channel (which provides a wide open pathway) to get from the high concentration side to low concentration side of the membrane. This requires no energy as the molecule flows easily down its concentration gradient. In active transport, molecules are pumped by a membrane protein called an active transporter to get from the low concentration side to the high concentration side. This process requires energy, because the molecule must be pumped across the membrane against its natural concentration gradient.\r\n<br /><br />\r\nIn order to do their job, active transporters use the alternative access mechanism. At first, only one side of the transporter protein is open, allowing only substrate molecules on that side of the membrane to bind to the transporter. Then, a change in the transporter\'s shape occurs so that first the open side closes, and then the other side of the transporter protein opens, successfully moving the substrate molecule to its destination.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe surprise is that this perfect coordination works only for the main substrate of active transporters, while small molecules such as water seem to be able to sneak through while the protein is undergoing its shape change. The research conducted by the Tajkhorshid group suggests that this is likely a universal behavior for all active membrane transporters and a result of the very large structural changes they undergo.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nResearchers study membrane proteins using a tool called molecular dynamics. \"All the molecules in biology have to move to do their job. While you can see a lot of nice pictures of proteins showing their structure, but that\'s just a frozen state,\" Tajkhorshid said. \"In order to describe the function of a biomolecule, you have to see its motion, and molecular dynamics is a nice way to do this. The method essentially solves the Newtonian equations of motion for all the atoms in the molecule we like to study.\"\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe computer simulations involved in molecular dynamics determine the motion of the transporters using algorithms that define how the atoms of a transporter interact with each other, how they interact with solvent, and how they interact with other molecules in the system. These rules are used to calculate the total force acting on every atom at each step of the transporter\'s motion.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nHowever, challenges arise when doing these computer simulations because of the sheer number of atoms and the small time steps these simulations require.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"Atoms vibrate of a period of 10 femtoseconds [one quadrillionth of a second], so if you want to have ten snapshots nicely showing how it moves, you have to take a picture every one femtosecond to describe the natural motion of the system. Because we have to take such short time steps, calculating even a few microseconds of protein motion becomes computationally very expensive. Thanks to the power provided by the national supercomputing centers we have been able to accomplish such calculations.\" Tajkhorshid said.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nOnce these molecular dynamics simulations were up and running, members of Tajkhorshid\'s lab noticed something that they never expected to see: the transporters were leaking, allowing small amounts of water to pass through along with the substrate.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"Initially, I was surprised, because many people, including myself, assumed that these were perfect machines going back and forth between inward facing and outward facing states,\" Tajkhorshid said. \"For almost two years, my students told me that there was some water passing through, and I just told them to repeat their simulations using more carefully designed setups, and that something was probably wrong with their simulations!\"\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nWith a little digging, the researchers found that some other labs had experimentally shown that some transporters did, in fact, have this leaky quality.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"What we did in this work was to propose that it\'s not just one particular family that has this leakiness, but all of the transporters that we have been studying in the lab. We found that in all cases, every time the protein starts to undergo those large structural changes, leaks form,\" Tajkhorshid said.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nTajkhorshid likens this mechanism to a scenario familiar to most pet owners.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"When you open the door for someone to come in, the door has to completely open, but that provides access to small things like a dog or a cat to get out of the house. Because transporters move so much when allowing a substrate in, these leaks form, allowing water molecules in,\" Tajkhorshid said.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\nAlthough Tajkhorshid doesn\'t believe transporter leakiness plays a physiological role in the cell, this discovery adds some interesting new knowledge to the field about transporters.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\"Transporters are extremely important proteins, and we would love to understand their function and how they move. If we understand that better, then we might be able to design better, more specific drugs for transporters,\" Tajkhorshid said.\r\n</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20130507tajkhorshid/lab515.jpg\">\r\n<p class=\"small\">The lab group of Illinois professor of biochemistry Emad Tajkhorshid, pictured left to right: Giray Enkavi, Jing Li, Po-Chao Wen, Emad Tajkhorshid, and Zhijian Huang. </p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20130507tajkhorshid/emad300.jpg',1,'2013-05-06 21:00:00','MCB	Biochem','News','gillespi','2013-05-07 21:08:42','2013-07-18 18:58:53','Chelsey Coombs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(280,'William Metcalf Appointed As G.

','<p>The cell membrane serves as a protective barrier that lets only certain materials in or out of the cell, helping to maintain an environment conducive to cellular processes. There are many types of proteins embedded in the cell membrane that control which molecules can pass through, said University of Illinois biochemistry professor Emad Tajkhorshid, whose lab conducted the collaborative research with colleagues at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> Tajkhorshid&rsquo;s lab studies aquaporins, proteins responsible for water transport across the membrane. Aquaporins allow water molecules to pass through, but exclude protons which are even smaller in size, Tajkhorshid said. The selective abilities of aquaporins have great physiological importance, he said. </p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;The proton gradient across the membrane is a source of energy for the cell; it&rsquo;s almost like a battery for the cell, so if there are leaks, protons can go through too fast and kill the cell. But at the same time, you want to allow water to go through,&rdquo; Tajkhorshid said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the results of millions of years of evolution: to come up with a channel that is so specific for one or two types of molecules, but nothing else.&rdquo; </p>\r\n<p> Normally, protons &ldquo;hop&rdquo; from one water molecule to the next. Tajkhorshid compares this process to the behavior of a toy known as Newton&rsquo;s cradle. When the metallic ball on a string on one end of a Newton&rsquo;s cradle is lifted and released, it crashes into a line of other metallic balls on strings, transferring the force through the line and propelling the last ball outward. This is analogous to a proton crashing into a line of water molecules, Tajkhorshid said. </p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;One proton comes in, jumps on the first water molecule, but because that water already has two protons on it, it receives that one proton, then gives one of its protons to the next water. Then the next water gives this extra proton to the next water molecule,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This series of proton hops between seven or eight water molecules effectively results in the release of a proton from the other end.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Researchers used the highest-resolution crystal structure of a membrane protein ever solved to see some of the tiny hydrogen bonds within the protein, and they discovered yet another mechanism the aquaporin uses to stifle proton transport.</p>\r\n<p> After the chain of water molecules enters the pore, it passes through the narrowest region (called the selectivity filter), causing the water molecules to remain, as Tajkhorshid said, &ldquo;strictly single file.&rdquo; This results in a &ldquo;high correlation between the water molecules&rsquo; motions in the selectivity filter,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;We used molecular dynamics simulations to show how the atoms interact with each other and what forces are acting between them to predict the trajectory of each atom. We saw that the highest correlation between two neighboring water molecules is in the selectivity filter. That means they move together like they are connected to each other tightly,&rdquo; Tajkhorshid said.</p>\r\n<p> These correlational measures show that the two water molecules in this narrow passage behave differently than those in the rest of the chain above and below this region, Tajkhorshid said. </p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;Outside the selectivity filter, you have a nice chain of water molecules moving together – a little playful but still moving together. But then you come to this high fit region, where these two water molecules are moving together but at the cost of becoming isolated from the others,&rdquo; Tajkhorshid said. &ldquo;When they pass this region, they rejoin the calmer chain of water molecules.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The breaking of the water molecule chain stops the characteristic proton hopping, keeping the protons from going through the aquaporin but allowing water through. </p>\r\n<p> This newly discovered mechanism joins a host of previously discovered mechanisms that are evolutionarily advantageous to the cell, Tajkhorshid said. </p>\r\n<p> &ldquo;Nature has evolved this protein system with multiple selectivity mechanisms working together. Cells with only one mechanism have the potential to fail, but if they have two or three complementary mechanisms working together, then they ensure that protons are strongly excluded,&rdquo; he said. </p>','http://mcb.illinois.edu/features/20130715emad/emad300.jpg',1,'2013-07-14 14:55:00','MCB	Biochem','Highlight','gillespi','2013-07-15 15:34:37','2013-08-21 17:36:05','','emad300.jpg','image/jpeg',32058,'2013-08-21 16:20:21',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',''),(286,'Supriya Prasanth receives NSF Career Award','Assistant Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Supriya Prasanth has received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award.','Assistant Professor of Cell and Developmental Biology Supriya Prasanth has received the National Science Foundation CAREER Award.

Two biochemically unique protein complexes of mTOR – mTORC1 and mTORC2 – have distinct kinase activities and assemble signaling pathways that differentially regulate those cellular and developmental processes. As hyper-activation of mTOR signaling underlies many human diseases including diabetes and cancer, Nature has most likely designed intrinsic breaks for these pathways. In this study led by Nidhi Khanna, a graduate student in the Chen laboratory, one such control mechanism has been identified for mTORC2. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rho small GTPases, XPLN, was first found by the researchers to interact with mTOR in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Experiments in mammalian cells subsequently revealed that XPLN specifically interacts with mTORC2, not mTORC1. XPLN inhibits mTORC2 kinase activity in vitro and signaling in cells. The inhibitory function of XPLN is specific for one of the targets of mTORC2 – the protein kinase Akt. In line with the well-established functions of Akt, XPLN negatively regulates cell survival and skeletal muscle differentiation through its inhibitory effect on mTORC2 and Akt. Interestingly, this novel function of XPLN does not require its GEF activity, but is instead dependent on its N-terminal region, most likely via direct physical interaction with mTORC2. As hyper-active Akt signaling is oncogenic and found in many human cancers, the discovery of the first mTORC2-specific endogenous inhibitor raises the possibility of tumor-suppressing function for XPLN, an intriguing question for future investigations.\r\n','',1,'2013-11-20 19:33:00','MCB	CDB','Highlight',NULL,'2013-11-20 19:38:30','2013-11-20 22:29:11','','MCB_Style20131120_300.jpg','image/jpeg',8966,'2013-11-20 22:29:11','20131120.png','image/png',25824,'2013-11-20 19:38:30','',''),(308,'Assistant Professor of MIP Sayee Anakk Publishes New Study in Cell Reports','Assistant Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Sayeepriyadarshini Anakk published an article in the November 21, 2013, edition of <em>Cell Reports</em> entitled \"Bile Acids Activate YAP to Promote Liver Carcinogenesis.\"\r\n','Assistant Professor of Molecular and Integrative Physiology Sayeepriyadarshini Anakk published an article in the November 21, 2013, edition of <em>Cell Reports</em> entitled \"Bile Acids Activate YAP to Promote Liver Carcinogenesis.\"\r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe article elucidates some of the ways elevated levels of bile acids cause liver cell carcinomas, including through the loss of the nuclear receptors FXR and SHP, as well as the activation of the Yes-associated Protein (YAP) of the Hippo pathway. \r\n<br /><br />\r\nThe MCB Communications Office also produced its first video abstract for the article.

Created in 1973 and named for the first March of Dimes chairman and president, this program provides funding to young investigators to start their own research projects on topics related to the March of Dimes mission. The grant provides $150,000 over a two-year period for research on alternative splicing’s role in Myotonic Dystrophy, a multi-systemic disease that affects about 1 in 8000 people.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAlternative splicing is a key mechanism that produces precise assortment of proteins for each cell type.  It is a highly regulated process, which when gone awry results in diseases like myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).  DM1 arises due to an unusual mutation where a small DNA segment of the mutated gene is repeated hundreds of times. When the mutated gene is copied into RNA, it gets trapped inside the nucleus and becomes toxic by disrupting function of muscleblind like (Mbnl) family of splicing regulatory factors. Mbnl proteins normally participate in regulation of developmental splicing transitions. Their inactivation in DM1 results in expression of embryonic splicing patterns, which is detrimental to the function of adult tissues.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWhile the role of Mbnl1 in DM1 skeletal and cardiac muscle pathology is clear, the effects of its loss of activity in the gastro-intestinal and other tissues are poorly understood. Dr. Kalsotra\'s project aims to characterize Mbnl1 function in the liver by identifying its RNA targets and determining the consequences of its loss on liver physiology and function. These studies will advance our understanding of Mbnl1 function in liver development and provide new insights into DM1 pathophysiology.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe mission of the March of Dimes is to promote healthy pregnancies and to support research that can lead to the prevention of birth defects. Dr. Kalsotra’s research will lead to our understanding of molecular mechanisms that may be responsible for the developmental defects observed in this debilitating disease.

To their knowledge, this is the first example of a radical reaction occurring on the methyl group of acetyl-CoA, providing potentially new tools for biosynthesis/modification of natural products and macromolecules in living organisms that require formation of a carbon-carbon bond.\r\n','',1,'2014-08-25 14:05:00','Biochem','News',NULL,'2014-08-25 14:12:52','2014-08-25 14:12:52','',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',''),(327,'Biochemistry notes the passing of noted former faculty member, J.

Accurate chromosome alignment and their faithful segregation are crucial for maintaining genomic stability. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1α), a bonafide component of the heterochromatin regulates various cellular processes including the establishment and maintenance of higher-order chromatin architecture, transcriptional elongation, DNA damage response, sister chromatid cohesion and centromere organization. HP1α is decorated with several post-translational modifications; however, the biological functions of these modifications remain elusive. This study from Prasanth laboratory spearheaded by Arindam Chakraborty, a postdoctoral associate revealed that the phosphorylation of HP1α dictates its mitotic function. \r\n\r\nIn this study, Prasanth and colleagues show that mammalian NDR kinase mediates the hinge specific phosphorylation of HP1α preferentially at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. During early mitosis, the hinge-phosphorylated form of HP1α is specifically enriched at the kinetochores and is involved in the association of Sgo1, a protein involved in chromosome cohesion to mitotic centromeres. NDR1 loss leads to impairment of Sgo1 binding to mitotic centromeres and this in turn causes chromosome alignment defects and prometaphase arrest. The present study reveals that the mitotic-specific hinge-phosphorylation of HP1α catalyzed by NDR kinase is required for accurate chromosome alignment and mitotic progression in human cells.','',1,'2014-09-03 13:33:00','MCB	CDB','Highlight',NULL,'2014-09-03 19:38:19','2014-09-04 15:51:53','','Chakrabortyfig_web.jpg','image/jpeg',49151,'2014-09-03 19:38:19','Chakraboty_cdb_web.jpg','image/jpeg',64179,'2014-09-04 15:51:53','The hinge-phosphorylated form of HP1α is localized to mitotic centromere','NDR kinase mediates hinge specific phosphorylation of HP1α, enriched at mitotic centromere, is required for accurate mitotic progression'),(334,'Scientists discover a new role for estrogen in the pathology of breast cancer','Biochemistry professor David Shapiro (center), M.D.-Ph.D student Neal Andruska (left), graduate student Xiaobin Zheng and their colleagues discovered a new mechanism by which estrogen contributes to the pathology of breast cancer.

Ortega, chemistry professor Wilfred van der Donk, graduate student Yue Hao, biochemistry professor Satish Nair, and postdoctoral researcher Mark Walker solved a decades-old mystery into how a broad class of natural antibiotics are made.','Researchers, including biochemistry professor Satish Nair, report in the journal Nature that they have made a breakthrough in understanding how a powerful antibiotic agent is made in nature. Their discovery solves a decades-old mystery, and opens up new avenues of research into thousands of similar molecules, many of which are likely to be medically useful.  </br></br>\r\n\r\nThe team focused on a class of compounds that includes dozens with antibiotic properties. The most famous of these is nisin, a natural product in milk that can be synthesized in the lab and is added to foods as a preservative. Nisin has been used to combat food-borne pathogens since the late 1960s.</br></br>\r\n\r\nResearchers have long known the sequence of the nisin gene, and they can assemble the chain of amino acids (called a peptide) that are encoded by this gene. But the peptide undergoes several modifications in the cell after it is made, changes that give it its final form and function. Researchers have tried for more than 25 years to understand how these changes occur.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“Peptides are a little bit like spaghetti; they’re too flexible to do their jobs,” said University of Illinois chemistry professor Wilfred van der Donk, who led the research with biochemistry professor Satish K. Nair. “So what nature does is it starts putting knobs in, or starts making the peptide cyclical.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nSpecial enzymes do this work. For nisin, an enzyme called a dehydratase removes water to help give the antibiotic its final, three-dimensional shape. This is the first step in converting the spaghetti-like peptide into a five-ringed structure, van der Donk said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe rings are essential to nisin’s antibiotic function: Two of them disrupt the construction of bacterial cell walls, while the other three punch holes in bacterial membranes. This dual action is especially effective, making it much more difficult for microbes to evolve resistance to the antibiotic.</br></br>\r\n\r\nPrevious studies showed that the dehydratase was involved in making these modifications, but researchers have been unable to determine how it did so. This lack of insight has prevented the discovery, production and study of dozens of similar compounds that also could be useful in fighting food-borne diseases or dangerous microbial infections, van der Donk said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThrough a painstaking process of elimination, Manuel Ortega, a graduate student in van der Donk’s lab, established that the amino acid glutamate was essential to nisin’s transformation.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“They discovered that the dehydratase did two things,” Nair said. “One is that it added glutamate (to the nisin peptide), and the second thing it did was it eliminated glutamate. But how does one enzyme have two different activities?”</br></br>\r\n\r\nTo help answer this question, Yue Hao, a graduate student in Nair’s lab, used X-ray crystallography to visualize how the dehydratase bound to the nisin peptide. She found that the enzyme interacted with the peptide in two ways: It grasped one part of the peptide and held it fast, while a different part of the dehydratase helped install the ring structures.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“There’s a part of the nisin precursor peptide that is held steady, and there’s a part that is flexible. And the flexible part is actually where the chemistry is carried out,” Nair said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nOrtega also made another a surprising discovery: transfer-RNA, a molecule best known for its role in protein production, supplies the glutamate that allows the dehydratase to help shape the nisin into its final, active form.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“In this study, we solve a lot of questions that people have had about how dehydration works on a chemical level,” van der Donk said. “And it turns out that in nature a fairly large number of natural products – many of them with therapeutic potential – are made in a similar fashion. This really is like turning on a light where it was dark before, and now we and other labs can do all kinds of things that we couldn\'t do previously.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nVan der Donk is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.

Pictured, left to right: Olivia Cangellaris, Paul Froeter, professor Xiuling Li, Wen Huang and professor Martha Gillette.','Tiny, thin microtubes could provide a scaffold for neuron cultures to grow so that researchers can study neural networks, their growth and repair, yielding insights into treatment for degenerative neurological conditions or restoring nerve connections after injury.</br></br>\r\n\r\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the University of Wisconsin-Madison created the microtube platform to study neuron growth. They posit that the microtubes could one day be implanted like stents to promote neuron regrowth at injury sites or to treat disease.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“This is a powerful three-dimensional platform for neuron culture,” said Xiuling Li, U. of I. professor of electrical and computer engineering who co-led the study along with UW-Madison professor Justin Williams. “We can guide, accelerate and measure the process of neuron growth, all at once.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe team published the results in the journal ACS Nano.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“There are a lot of diseases that are very difficult to figure out the mechanisms of in the body, so people grow cultures on platforms so we can see the dynamics under a microscope,” said U. of I. graduate student Paul Froeter, the first author of the study. “If we can see what’s happening, hopefully we can figure out the cause of the deficiency and remedy it, and later integrate that into the body.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe biggest challenge facing researchers trying to culture neurons for study is that it’s very difficult to recreate the cozy, soft, three-dimensional environment of the brain. Other techniques have used glass plates or channels carved into hard slabs of material, but the nerve cells look and behave differently than they would in the body. The microtubes provide a three-dimensional, pliant scaffolding, the way that the cellular matrix does in the body.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe team uses an array of microtubes, made with a technique pioneered in Li’s lab for electronics applications such as 3-D inductors. Very thin membranes of silicon nitride roll themselves up into tubes of precise dimensions. The tubes are about as wide as the cells, as long as a human hair is wide, and spaced apart about as far as they are long. The neurons grow along and through the microtubes, sending out exploratory arms across the gaps to find the next tube.</br></br>\r\n\r\nFroeter devised a way to mount the microtubes on glass slides, the standard for biological cultures. The thin silicon nitride tubes are transparent, so researchers can watch the live neuron cells as they grow using a conventional microscope.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“Having the ability to see through both the tube and the underlying substrate has been really enlightening,” said Williams, a professor of biomedical engineering at UW-Madison. “Without this we may have noticed an overall increase in growth rates, but we never would have observed the dramatic changes that occur as the cells transition from the flat regions to the tube inlets.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe microtubes not only provide structure for the neural network, guiding connections, but also accelerate the nerve cells’ growth – and time is crucial for restoring severed connections in the case of spinal cord injury or limb reattachment.</br></br>\r\n\r\nBecause they are so thin, the microtubes are flexible enough to wrap around the cells without damaging or flattening them. The researchers found that the axons, the long branches the nerve cells send out to make connections, grow through the microtubes like a sheath – and at up to 20 times the speed of growing across the gaps.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“It’s not surprising that the axons like to grow within the tubes,” Williams said. “These are exactly the types of spaces where they grow in vivo. What was really surprising was how much faster they grew. This now gives us a powerful investigative tool as we look to further optimize tube structure and geometry.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe microtube arrays can be tuned to any dimensions needed, since nerve cells vary greatly in size from small brain cells to large muscle-controlling nerves. Li and Froeter have already sent microtube arrays of various dimensions to other research groups studying neural networks for diverse applications.</br></br>\r\n\r\nFor Li’s group, the next step is to put electrodes in the microtubes so researchers can measure the electrical signals that the nerves conduct.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“If we place electrodes inside the tube, since they are directly in contact with the axon, we will be able to study signal conduction much better than conventional methods,” Li said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThey also are working to stack the microtubes in multiple layers so that bundles of nerves can grow in a 3-D network.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“If we can grow lines of neurons together in a bundle, we could simulate what’s going down your spine or going to your limbs,” Froeter said. “Then we can take mature cultures and sever them, then introduce the microtubes and see how they regrow.”</br></br>\r\n\r\n“Getting to the clinic will take a long time, but that is what keeps us motivated,” Li said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe Andrew T.

The disorder can lead to scarring of the ovaries, fallopian tubes and other tissues; infertility; inflammation and chronic pain.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“The usual treatments for endometriosis are aimed at suppressing estrogen production because it’s an estrogen-driven disease,” said University of Illinois molecular and integrative physiology professor Benita Katzenellenbogen, who led the new study with chemistry professor John Katzenellenbogen. “We thought that a better approach might be to interfere with both of the main aspects of endometriosis: the growth-promoting actions and also the inflammatory aspects – both of which involve the estrogen receptor,” she said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nCurrent pharmaceutical treatments can suppress endometriosis, but often fail to reduce the pain and inflammation that are hallmarks of the disorder, said John Katzenellenbogen, whose laboratory developed the new compounds.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“Current treatments also have side effects on other tissues through which estrogens work, and so they can’t be taken forever,” he said. “There also is unfortunately a high rate of recurrence of the disease.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe new compounds, OBHS (oxabicycloheptene sulfonate) and CLI (chloroindazole), interact with two types of estrogen receptors (ER-alpha and ER-beta, respectively). Each drug reduced the size of endometriotic tissue or prevented its growth outside the uterus in mice. Each also reduced inflammation and suppressed the development of new neurons and blood vessels that support the misplaced tissue. The treatments did not reduce fertility or the health of young pups born to mouse mothers that had undergone the therapies.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe compounds had similar positive effects in human endometriotic cells that were grown in culture with human immune cells, called macrophages, which can contribute to the inflammation and growth of endometriotic tissue. </br></br>\r\n\r\nThe research team also found that adding either of the new compounds to a common endometriosis treatment, letrazole, did a better job of suppressing endometriosis than letrazole alone.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“Inflammation is a driver of endometriosis,“ Benita Katzenellenbogen said. “At some point you’ve got to turn it off, and these compounds turn it off by working through the estrogen receptors.”\r\nIn a previous study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that CLI suppressed – and even reversed – the loss of brain neuron structure and function in a mouse model of MS.</br></br>\r\n\r\nWhile many more years of work must be done to test these new compounds in other models and, eventually, in human patients, the work demonstrates a new approach to treating endometriosis and other disorders tied to estrogen signaling and inflammation, the researchers said.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at the National Institutes of Health supported this research.</br></br>\r\n\r\nArticle by Diana Yates</br>\r\nPhoto by L.

The findings are published in a recent edition of PNAS.','An experimental drug rapidly shrinks most tumors in a mouse model of human breast cancer, researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. When mice were treated with the experimental drug, BHPI, “the tumors immediately stopped growing and began shrinking rapidly,” said University of Illinois biochemistry professor and senior author David Shapiro. “In just 10 days, 48 out of the 52 tumors stopped growing, and most shrank 30 to 50 percent.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe key to the drug’s potency lies in its unusual mode of action, Shapiro said.  </br></br>\r\n“BHPI works through the estrogen receptor protein, but in a way that is different than estrogenic hormones,” he said. “The drug hyperactivates a pathway called the unfolded protein response, which estrogens normally use to protect cells from stress and help them grow.”  </br></br>\r\n\r\nRather than blocking the stress response, BHPI kicks the UPR into overdrive, said M.D./Ph.D. student and lead author Neal Andruska.  </br></br>\r\n\r\n“This drives the cancer cells from using the UPR in a protective way into making it a lethal pathway,” Andruska said. “In this way, it stops growth and eventually kills many types of breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer cells that contain estrogen receptor.”</br>\r\n</br>\r\n  BHPI shuts down the production of new proteins, including proteins that normally keep the stress response pathway in check, Andruska said. </br></br>\r\n\r\n  “Eventually, many cancer cells die – in part because they can’t make any new proteins,” he said.   </br></br>\r\n\r\nBHPI spurs a number of events in the cell, including the opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, a special intracellular compartment. The influx of calcium into the cytoplasm sets off a cascade of events that prepare the cell to deal with stress. The cells try to pump the calcium back into its compartment, but BHPI keeps the calcium channels open, allowing the calcium to flow back into the cytoplasm. After about 30 minutes of this “futile cycle,” the cells run low on energy. </br></br>\r\n\r\n(Watch a movie of cancer cells responding to estrogen and BHPI: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4tzdwx1SwM&feature=youtu.be\" >Anticancer Drug BHPI Hyperactivates a Cell Stress Response to Kill Cancer Cells</a>)</br></br>\r\n\r\n  “Without enough energy, cancer cells don’t grow,” Shapiro said. The cascade initiated by BHPI eventually turns on four pathways, “each of which could potentially contribute to the death of the cancer cells,” he said.   </br></br>\r\n\r\nBecause the UPR pathway is overexpressed in therapy-resistant cancer cells, the drug is especially effective in targeting estrogen receptor-positive cells that are resistant to tamoxifen and other anti-cancer drugs, the researchers report.   </br></br>\r\n\r\n“BHPI works equally well in the presence or absence of estrogen,” Shapiro said. </br></br>\r\n\r\n  The mice that received the drug tolerated it well, with no weight loss or other negative side effects, the researchers said.  </br></br>\r\n\r\n “It’s still in the early days for this drug, and there are many hurdles to overcome to bring BHPI to the clinic,” Shapiro said. “But so far, it’s been clearing the hurdles by a wide margin.”</br></br>\r\n\r\n  The study team also includes researchers from the U. of I. department of food science and human nutrition, the department of molecular and integrative physiology, the College of Medicine and the U. of I.

The dormant microbes are able to recover if the virus goes away within 24 to 48 hours—otherwise they die.\r\n</br></br> \r\n\r\n“The microbe is hedging its bet,” said Associate Professor of Microbiology Rachel Whitaker, who led the research at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology. “If they go dormant, they might die, but we think this must be better than getting infected and passing it on.”  </br></br>\r\n\r\n<i>Sulfolobus</i> is a species of archaea (a domain of single-celled organisms distinct from bacteria) found in acidic hot springs all over the world, where free viruses are not as common as in other environments. These microbes will go dormant in the presence of just a few viruses, whether active or inactive. While inactivated virus particles cannot infect a host, Whitaker’s lab found they could still cause dormancy, and ultimately, death in <i>Sulfolobus</i>.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“People thought these inactivated viruses were just an accident, that they were just mispackaged,” Whitaker said. “Now we know they are being sensed by the host so they are having an effect. People are starting to think that it is adaptive for the virus to produce inactivated virus particles.”</br></br>\r\n\r\n<i>Sulfolobus</i> have an adaptive immune system found in archaea and bacteria that allows the microbe to encode a specific piece of DNA that matches the viral DNA, causing it to target the viral DNA and degrade it thus preventing the virus from propagating, or reproducing. Cultures with immunity to SSV9 recover from dormancy and grow normally once the virus is removed from the culture. Microbes without this immunity are susceptible to infection and eventually kill their neighbors by maintaining viral particles in the environment.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe researchers do not know exactly what is going on while the microbes are dormant, only that the microbes look drastically different in that state. More research is needed to better understand these new interactions between microbes and viruses. Incorporating these findings into models will show the true ecological impact of viruses in the microbial world, Whitaker said.</br></br>\r\n\r\n“We really don’t understand the way that viruses affect microbes,” Whitaker said. “There is a lot to learn. These communities are usually modeled where a virus will either kill the microbe or the microbe is resistant. But actually there are all these other subtleties going on, like dormancy, that are having a bigger impact than we understand.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nDormant microbes are found everywhere, in water, soil, and even the human gut, said Maria Bautista, a graduate student in Whitaker’s lab, who led the research.</br></br>\r\n \r\n“Many microbes go dormant when they face environmental stress such as a change in pH or temperature ” Bautista said. “Maybe virus-induced dormancy is something that doesn’t just happen in <i>Sulfolobus</i>; it may be a widespread response to viruses in other environments. We don’t know.”</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe NSF supported this work.

The structure of the 270-kDa RNA repair complex revealed that it is built like a shopping mall, and RNA repair can be achieved having the damaged RNA visiting four active sites with a minimum travelling distance. The findings are published in <i>Nature Communications</i>.','To fight for a limited resource of nutrition in the wildness, microbes release toxins to kill their neighbors to increase their share of nutrition. A majority of toxins are ribotoxins that cleave essential RNAs involved in protein translation, which are conserved in and required for all organisms to live. To counter the damage inflicted by ribotoxins, organisms employ protein enzymes to repair the damaged RNA for survival. Over the past several years, the Huang group has been engaged in discovery, biochemical and structural characterization of RNA repair systems. Significant research includes the discovery of a Pnkp–Hen1 RNA repair complex that carries out RNA repair with immunity. In the present study, published in the journal <i>Nature Communications</i>, Huang and coworkers described the discovery and characterization of a new bacterial RNA repair complex.</br></br>\r\n\r\nThe approach involved bioinformatic analyses to reveal the presence of a new putative RNA repair system in certain bacteria. The genes encoding three proteins (named Pnkp1, Rnl, and Hen1) that constitute the putative new RNA repair system were then cloned into expression vectors. All three proteins were overexpressed in <i>E. coli</i> and purified to homogeneity. <i>In vitro</i> reconstitution using the purified recombinant proteins and a ribotoxin-cleaved RNA substrate demonstrated that RNA repair requires the presence of all three proteins. Furthermore, the three proteins were shown to form a heterohexamer <i>in vitro</i>. Huang and coworkers were able to crystallize and solve the structure of the Pnkp–Rnl–Hen1 heterohexamer. The structure revealed the molecular architecture of the heterohexamer as two ring structures of Pnkp1–Rnl–Hen1 heterotrimer fused at the Pnkp1 dimer interface. The four active sites required for RNA repair are located on the inner rim of each ring, reminiscent of architectures of shopping malls. This particular arrangement of the four active sites suggests that RNA repair might be carried out via a “one-stop shopping” mechanism.</br></br>\r\n\r\nUnlike the Pnkp–Hen1 RNA repair complex, which is present in many bacteria, the newly discovered Pnkp1–Rnl–Hen1 RNA repair complex is only found in ten bacterial species so far. Interestingly, the majority of the bacteria possessing the newly discovered RNA repair complex live in gingival plaques of human mouth. Huang hypothesized that the unique RNA repair carried out by the Pnkp1–Rnl–Hen1 complex in these bacteria might provide them with a heightened ability to survive. If this hypothesis proves to be correct, inhibiting RNA repair might provide a vehicle to reduce the population of these bacteria, which are linked to human dental and gum diseases. Development of small-molecule inhibitors of the new RNA repair complex is currently underway in Huang laboratory to test this possibility.\r\n','',1,'2015-04-17 17:42:00','MCB	Biochem','Highlight',NULL,'2015-04-17 17:55:48','2015-04-18 15:18:01','','MCB_image_web.jpg','image/jpeg',102216,'2015-04-17 17:55:48',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Surface representation of the crystal structure of the Pnkp1–Rnl–Hen1 heterohexamer.
