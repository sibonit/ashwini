Navigation

  Level 1 & 2 from top.
    Sidebar for level 3

  How to display them?
#    Wide menu, but leave a little room on the side
#      examples: engineering
#    Drop down on hover
#      remove caret from menu heading
    weird idea: have increasing translucency for last 10's of pixels
      in dropdown menu div
      currently using shadow - looks nice

  Search spyglass (and home icon?) in navigation bar
    with drop shadow looks nice (engineering)


Layout
  Get large blue header to appear above nav

  Front page
    Top navigation + giant image + footer
      or
    Top navigation + news slideshow, calendar + footer
      slideshow - wide, like illinois

  develop CSS
    top & secondary pages


Slideshow layout
#  overlay text
#    with translucent highlight color
    need a little left & right padding


News
  Layout
    let's try row of image & headline in one column
    then we can have selectors like Current, 2015, 2014, etc.
  need other fields?  Borrowed from MCB.
  News items should have a picture.  What if it doesn't?


Calendar
  Need master & other calendars in Toolbox to pull events from
  Database / views
  Syncing script
