<h3><strong>Financial Aid</strong></h3>
<p>Financial aid is available in the form of fellowships, tuition and fee waivers, teaching and research assistantships, federal training program, and loans. Financial need is not a factor in awarding fellowships, tuition and fee waivers, or assistantships administered by the University. Priority for financial aid is given to doctoral students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information about availability, see the <a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/funding-jobs" target="_blank">Graduate College</a> information.</p>

<h3><strong>Admissions Decisions</strong></h3>
<p>Candidates for admission to graduate study are chosen by the PEEC Admissions Committee. If invited to visit during our Recruiting Weekend (usually the first weekend in February), part of your itinerary will include an interview by the PEEC Admissions Committee. The interview usually lasts approximately 15 minutes. You will be asked about your research interests and experiences and expectations regarding grad school<strong>.</strong> It is suggested that you wear nice, but comfortable clothing to your interview (in other words, nothing formal, such as a suit). Based on its decisions, offers for admission are made to selected candidates. Candidates offered admission are also offered financial support in the form of assistantships, fellowships and tuition waivers. By agreement with many other U.S. graduate programs, these offers remain in effect until April 15; however, your acceptance earlier is appreciated. Admission recommendations made do not become official until the Office of Admissions and Records issues a "Notice of Admission" and sends registration instructions to the candidates who have accepted offers. In general, if your academic credentials are in order, the Office of Admissions and Records will accept the Department's recommendations and issue the "Notice of Admission."</p>
