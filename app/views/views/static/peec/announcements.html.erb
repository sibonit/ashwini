<p><em><%= image_tag 'peec/helen_crop.jpg', width: '144px', height: '100px', :style => 'float: left' %> 9/2008</em> &nbsp; <strong>Helen Bustamante</strong>, a Ph.D. candidate in PEEC, gave a talk about her recent collaboration with post-doc Nils Carlsson at the <a href="http://www.ecostudies.org/" target="_blank">Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies</a>, Millbrook, NY. This summer, Nils and Helen investigated a phenomenon Helen had seen in the river whereby virtually all adult zebra mussels disappeared from the freshwater part of the estuary at the end of summer. They designed a set of exclusion experiments to investigate predation on zebra mussel populations in the river. The talk title was "Who's eating Hudson River Zebra Mussels?" and was geared to a general audience. It was part of the DEC program series at Tivoli Bays Visitors Center, Watts dePeyster Hall, Tivoli, NY. (Click on photo for full image of them in the field.)<br /> <br /> In addition, Helen was recently awarded a fellowship from the Hudson River National Estuarine Research Reserve for the quality and relevance of her work to river management and her continuing outreach activities.</p>
