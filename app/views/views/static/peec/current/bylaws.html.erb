 			<div id="link1" class="sublinks collapse">
			 	<ul><p><br>As the vanguard in ecological, evolutionary and conservation biology research, the interdepartmental Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (PEEC) provides graduate training leading to the Masters and Doctoral degrees and promotes research that will advance these fields. The program draws on faculty from the School of Integrative Biology, the College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences, the Illinois Natural History Survey, the Department of Civil Engineering, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and other campus units. Research in the Program addresses basic ecological and evolutionary processes at the genetic, physiological, population, community and ecosystem levels, and includes application of scientific principles to current environmental problems such as global change, conservation biology, and restoration ecology. Graduate training is flexible and designed to promote broad interaction across sub-disciplines in the Program. In preparation for careers in academia, government, or the private sector, students will achieve a thorough understanding of the concepts of ecology, evolutionary, and conservation biology as well as proficiency in analytical and quantitative methods. </ul></p><br>

			 <ul><p><br>Prospective candidates must meet the requirements for admission set by the Graduate College of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Only applicants who have graduated from an accredited college or university and who hold or will be granted a baccalaureate degree (or its equivalent) comparable in content and completed credit hours to that granted by the University of Illinois will be considered. Applicants must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0 (A=4.0) computed from the last 2 years of undergraduate and all years of graduate work completed. The program will give preference to candidates who hold a baccalaureate degree in biology or a closely related discipline and show promise of excellence in research and teaching. Typically, only students with strong letters of recommendation, high scores on the Graduate Record Examinations and a GPA well above the minimum stated above and will be admitted, although demonstration of academic excellence by other means (e.g., extensive field or laboratory research experience) will be considered. Decisions concerning admission will be made by the Graduate Committee of the program.</ul></p></br>
