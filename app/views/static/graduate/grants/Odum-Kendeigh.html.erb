<h2>Eugene P. Odum - S. Charles Kendeigh </h2>
<h4 style="text-align:center;"> Fund in Support of Graduate Research in Ecology, Behavior and Evolutionary Biology</h4>

<p>Dr. Eugene Odum established the Odum-Kendeigh fund for graduate research in the fields of ecology, behavior and evolution in the Department of Animal Biology in honor of his major professor, Dr. Charles Kendeigh and the Department of Zoology (now Animal Biology) from which he received his Ph.D. Dr. Odum is one of the most influential figures in the field of ecology. He has been dubbed "the father of modern ecology" and is credited with pioneering the concept of the ecosystem. His textbook Fundamentals of Ecology, published in 1953, was the catalyst that changed ecology from the study of the microcosm to the study of the macrocosm. Dr. Odum was inducted into the Ecology Hall of Fame in 2002.</p>
