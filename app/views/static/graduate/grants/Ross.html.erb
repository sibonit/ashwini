A Guggenheim Fellow, Dr. Ross was also a fellow of both the Entomological Society and the Royal Entomological Society of London.</p>
<p>Jean Alexander Ross was not only Herbert Holdsworth Ross' devoted wife of 46 years but also shared his deep love of biological science and was his valued colleague. After obtaining her Bachelors and Masters degrees, she came to the University of Illinois and worked with Dr. Harley J. VanCleave in his studies of Acanthocephala intestinal parasites. Mrs. Ross published papers on zoology laboratory techniques and co-authored several of Dr. VanCleave's Acanthocephala papers.

An accomplished artist, she drew many of the original illustrations in the Textbook of Entomology and re-drew and clarified many other drawings in the book</p>
