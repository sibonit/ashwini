<h3>1. How do I apply to a graduate program at the University of Illinois?</h3>

<p>To begin, go to the web page for the <a href="http://www.grad.uiuc.edu/">Graduate College</a> at the University of Illinois and click on the "Apply" link (under <em>Prospective Students</em>), or <a href="http://www.grad.uiuc.edu/admissions/apply/">click here</a>.
The Graduate College web pages give you a great deal of useful information and complete instructions for applying.
You will need to know the name of the graduate program to which you wish to apply and its program code (see question 3, below, for program codes).
In addition, if you are from outside the USA, you should be aware that international students may be required to supply credentials in addition to those required of domestic students.</p>

<h3>2. When should I apply?</h3>
<p>In general, apply in the fall of one year for admission starting for the fall of the next year.
Most programs have admission deadlines around or just after the first of the year.
In addition, most programs will accept students starting only in the fall, though there are exceptions.
Check with the particular program you are interested in.</p>

The masters programs may or may not require a GRE score.
Scores must be reported via official transcripts, not just by a communication from you.
Some programs require that the exam be taken within a minimum of years.
