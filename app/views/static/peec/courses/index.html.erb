<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>Because of the breadth of fields covered by this program, there are no fixed courses required of all students other than IB 546A (and IB 546B for new first-year students)&mdash;see <a href="/peec/core" target="_blank">Core Courses</a>. The goal is to allow maximum flexibility while providing close supervision. It is strongly recommended that you confer with your advisor regarding the courses which you should take.</p>
<p>The number of courses and the particular courses taken depend on the individual's previous training and knowledge. Courses and laboratory and field experiences are supplemented by&nbsp;<a href="/peec/courses/#CourseAreas" target="_blank">Other Courses</a> below for suggestions).</p>
<p><strong>Doctoral students:</strong>&nbsp;You must complete at least 96 hours of 400- or 500-level courses (64 hours beyond the M.S. requirements) with grades no lower than B or S.</p>
<p><strong>Terminal Master's students:</strong>&nbsp;By the end of the second year, you must complete 32 hours of course work in your three core areas with grades no lower than B or S. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">No more than 12 hours of research (590 or 599 courses) can be counted</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h4>Individual Topics (590) or Thesis Research (599):</h4>
<p><strong>Doctoral students</strong> should be registered in IB 590 before your Prelim and then in 599 from the time of your Prelim until your Final Defense. Terminal <strong>Master&rsquo;s students</strong> need to register in at least one semester of 599, but may register in 599 for all terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approved rubrics for 599 are&nbsp;BIOL, NRES, ENT or PBIO. Approval to count 599 courses in rubrics other than those listed above, must be granted through a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/petition_form.pdf">petition</a>. The CRNs used for IB 590 and the 599 courses are individual to your advisor, and sometimes the semester. Please contact the PEEC secretary (or the secretary of your advisor's department) to obtain the correct CRN. Note: The number in the Course Schedule is a generic number and is&nbsp;<strong>NOT&nbsp;</strong>the correct number to use.</p>

<h4><a id="CourseAreas"></a><a id="Top"></a>Other Courses:</h4>
<p>Each semester, <a href="/peec/special" target="_blank">Special Topics</a> courses are offered that may be of particular interest to students in the Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology.</p>
<p>Also, the following is a partial list of courses that may be taken by PEEC students. You may want to take a look at the <a href="http://sib.illinois.edu/courses/semesters.html" target="_blank">advanced IB courses by semester controlled by IB</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>
