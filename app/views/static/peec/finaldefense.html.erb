<h1>Steps for Final Defense</h1>
<p><strong>Doctoral Students:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before your Defense</em></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: undefined;">
<li><strong>Register for 599 Thesis Research after Prelim and until Final Defense</strong>. You <em>must</em> be registered in the semester in which you take your final exam. Doctoral students should register for 590 Individual Topics up until your Prelim and then register for 599 Thesis Research from the time of your Prelim until your Final Defense.</li>
<li><strong>Complete at least 96 credit hours</strong> of 400- or 500-level courses (64 hours beyond the M.S. requirements) with grades no lower than B or S, and complete at least two semesters of favorably evaluated teaching.</li>
<li><strong>Add yourself to the degree list</strong> in the term you plan to deposit your thesis/dissertation via <a href="https://apps.uillinois.edu/selfservice/" target="_blank">UI Integrate Self-Service</a>. You do not need to be registered in the semester in which you deposit your dissertation if it is not the same semester as the one in which you took your final exam.</li>
<li><strong>Reserve a room for your defense</strong> after the date and time have been approved by your defense committee, and inform PEEC&rsquo;s secretary of the date, time, and place. If you need help in reserving a room, contact PEEC's secretary.</li>
<li>Give the names of your committee members and the chair to PEEC&rsquo;s secretary in order to <strong>get approval from the Grad College for your committee</strong>. This <em>must</em> be done before your defense, preferably at least 3 weeks before. (For this exam, your major advisor is appointed Chair of your committee. See PEEC&rsquo;s <a href="http://sib.illinois.edu/Peec/handbook#V" target="_blank">Graduate Program Handbook</a> for specifications for your committee.)</li>
<li><strong>Schedule your exit seminar </strong>(this can be scheduled as one of PEEC&rsquo;s weekly seminars by contacting PEEC&rsquo;s secretary or the seminar coordinator before the beginning of the school year). Again, inform PEEC&rsquo;s secretary of the date, time, and place of your exit seminar if not scheduled as one of PEEC&rsquo;s weekly seminars.</li>
<li><strong>File your title page with the Graduate College Thesis Office</strong> via <a href="mailto:thesis@illinois.edu">thesis@illinois.edu</a>. This optional step can be done any time before your deposit and after you're reasonably sure of your title. Make sure your title page is formatted correctly (see <a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/graduate-college-thesis-requirements" target="_blank">Grad College Thesis Requirements</a>). If you have any questions about this, send your title page to PEEC's secretary first to be approved before sending it to the Thesis Office.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>After your defense </em></p>
<ol>
<li>After you have made the revisions recommended by your committee, make sure that you have followed the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/graduate-college-thesis-requirements" target="_blank">Grad College Thesis Requirements</a> for formatting your dissertation, and then <strong>email the PEEC&rsquo;s secretary a copy of your dissertation for format review <span style="text-decoration: underline;">at least</span> 4-5 days before the deposit deadline</strong>.</li>
<li>After making any necessary format changes suggested by the secretary, resubmit the final revision to the secretary for a final review and approval. The secretary will then submit a <strong>format approval form </strong>to the Grad College and notify you that you may then submit your dissertation for electronic deposit to the Graduate College.</li>
<li>Give <strong>your <a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/forms/tda" target="_blank">Thesis/Dissertation Approval (TDA) form</a></strong> signed by all of your committee members to PEEC&rsquo;s secretary, who is authorized to submit it electronically to the Grad College.</li>
<li><strong>Deposit your dissertation and submit supplemental materials.</strong><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>Convert your dissertation file(s) to a single PDF file, if not already in that format.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
<li>Name the PDF file: Lastname_Firstname.pdf (use first and last names from title page; do not include middle names/initials in filename)</li>
<li>Do not embed audio/video files in or apply security settings to PDF file</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.grad.illinois.edu/submit-etd" target="_blank">www.grad.illinois.edu/submit-etd</a> to create a submission profile and submit your electronic dissertation.</li>
<li><strong>At the same time</strong>, submit the following materials to the Thesis Office (the deposit is not complete until all items are received):<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
