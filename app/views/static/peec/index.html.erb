<p>The <strong>Program in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology (PEEC)</strong> is an interdisciplinary, campuswide program designed to provide individualized training for graduate students. This program prepares individuals for research and teaching careers in ecology and evolutionary biology and produces scientists who are both technically competent and broadly educated in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
    <h3>A Ph.D. student declares three areas of emphasis:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A general area of ecology or evolution</li>
      <li>A complementary general area (e.g., behavior, systematics, physiology, genetics)</li>
      <li>A specific area related to the dissertation</li>
    </ul>
